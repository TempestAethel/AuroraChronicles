### **Act I: The Shattering** 

## **Chapter 1: The Experiment (Part 1)**  

The sterile hum of fluorescent lights buzzed faintly above, their monotonous drone amplified by the suffocating silence of the lab. Avery Sinclair stared at the device resting on the table before them—a polished metal cylinder, no larger than a coffee thermos, cradled in a tangle of wires and blinking LEDs. It was unassuming, almost banal in appearance, yet it held within it the culmination of five grueling years of research.  

Avery’s hands trembled as they adjusted the settings on the console. The screen reflected back their face: hollow eyes rimmed with dark circles, lips pressed into a thin, grim line. They hadn’t slept properly in days, and even now, their mind felt like a clenched fist, too tense to unfurl. Yet, this was it. The moment they had dreamed of, worked for, sacrificed for. The Memory Erasure and Rehabilitation Interface—the MERI Device—was ready for its first human test.  

“Subject calibration complete,” came the automated voice of the lab’s AI system, breaking the tension. The sound was smooth, clinical, devoid of emotion. “Awaiting final authorization.”  

Avery hesitated, their hand hovering over the console’s activation switch. The room felt suddenly too small, too quiet, as if the walls were leaning inward.  

“Everything’s in place, Avery,” Dr. Elise Grant said from across the room, her voice calm and precise. She was a tall woman, composed and meticulous, the type who could deliver a grim prognosis without breaking her stride. “We’ve triple-checked every parameter. If there’s a time to take the leap, it’s now.”  

Avery glanced at her, searching for reassurance in her sharp blue eyes. Elise’s presence had always been a grounding force, a counterweight to the chaos swirling inside Avery’s mind. But today, even Elise seemed strained, her usually unflappable demeanor fraying at the edges.  

“I know,” Avery replied, their voice thin, almost brittle. “It’s just… once we do this, there’s no turning back.”  

Elise tilted her head, studying Avery with a mixture of sympathy and impatience. “You’ve said it yourself—countless times. The potential outweighs the risks. Think of what this could mean for people suffering from trauma. Soldiers with PTSD, survivors of abuse. This is the future, Avery. Your future.”  

Avery nodded, their throat tightening. The words were familiar, comforting even, but they rang hollow now. The idealism that had driven them for years felt paper-thin, worn down by the weight of doubt.  

They turned back to the console, focusing on the blinking cursor awaiting their command.  

“Final subject approval required,” the AI repeated, its monotone voice slicing through the tension.  

The subject was Avery. They had volunteered for the first human trial—partly because they trusted no one else to take the risk, and partly because of the nagging guilt festering inside them. If anyone should shoulder the consequences of failure, it was the device’s creator.  

Avery’s finger hovered over the touchpad, hesitating for a fraction of a second. Then, with a sharp inhale, they pressed the confirmation button.  

“Authorization received. Initializing neural interface.”  

The device emitted a low hum, a vibration so subtle it was more felt than heard. Avery lowered themselves into the sleek chair at the center of the room, their head pressing back against the neural interface. A series of small mechanical arms extended, gently positioning electrodes along their temples and the base of their skull.  

“Stay still,” Elise instructed, her voice quieter now. “You’ll feel a slight pressure as the system synchronizes.”  

Avery braced themselves, gripping the armrests tightly. The first sensation was strange but not painful—a faint buzzing at the edge of their awareness, like static creeping into the corners of their mind.  

Then came the memories.  

They unfolded in sharp, vivid flashes, cascading one after another like a deck of cards being shuffled too fast. Childhood laughter, muffled sobs, the sound of shattering glass. A moment of joy at their university graduation, immediately overwritten by the gut-wrenching grief of standing in the rain at their father’s funeral. Each memory was crisp, painfully detailed, and entirely out of their control.  

“The interface is functioning,” Elise said, her voice a distant echo in Avery’s ears. “Cognitive activity is within expected parameters.”  

Avery’s breathing quickened as the memories became more fragmented, less coherent. Colors and sounds overlapped, forming surreal, nightmarish images. A glowing red sky. A faceless figure in a lab coat. A child’s laughter dissolving into an ear-piercing scream.  

“Elise—” Avery gasped, their voice trembling. “Something’s not right.”  

“Elise, monitor spike in neural feedback,” the AI interjected.  

Elise’s calm façade slipped for a moment, her fingers flying over the keyboard as she analyzed the data streaming across the console. “Your levels are spiking. Try to stay calm, Avery. I’m adjusting the parameters—”  

But Avery could barely hear her now. The hum of the device grew louder, resonating deep within their skull. The images came faster, more jumbled, each one tearing through their mind like shards of glass. They saw themselves in the lab, standing at the console. Then they were a child again, crying out for someone they couldn’t remember. Then—  

Everything went dark.

## **Chapter 1: The Experiment (Part 2)**  

Avery’s senses returned in pieces, as though they had been submerged underwater and were now struggling to break the surface. First, there was sound—the distant murmur of a voice, muffled and indistinct. Then came light, sharp and blinding, forcing their eyelids to flutter shut again. A dull ache radiated through their skull, a throbbing pulse synchronized with their heartbeat.  

“—Avery! Can you hear me?” Elise’s voice cut through the haze, sharp with urgency.  

Avery forced their eyes open, blinking against the harsh fluorescent lights. The lab came into focus in disjointed fragments: the blinking lights of the console, Elise’s pale, drawn face hovering above them, and the device—silent now, its once-blinking LEDs ominously dark.  

“What… what happened?” Avery croaked, their throat dry and raw.  

“You blacked out,” Elise said, her voice tight. “The neural interface overloaded. I had to shut it down manually.”  

Avery sat up too quickly, their head spinning from the effort. “Overloaded? How? We triple-checked the parameters—”  

“I know,” Elise interrupted, her tone sharp with frustration. “But something went wrong. Your neural activity spiked far beyond what the system was designed to handle. You’re lucky you didn’t fry your entire prefrontal cortex.”  

Her words lingered, heavy and foreboding, but Avery barely registered them. Their mind was still grappling with the aftershocks of the experience—the vivid, fragmented memories that had surged through them like a tidal wave. Even now, scraps of them lingered on the edge of their consciousness: the sound of a child’s laughter, the faceless figure, the unbearable sensation of being both here and not here.  

“Elise,” Avery said slowly, their voice trembling, “it wasn’t just the memories. Something… something else was there.”  

Elise’s brows furrowed. “What do you mean?”  

Avery shook their head, struggling to find the words. “It was like… I wasn’t alone. There was something—or someone—in my head. Watching me.”  

The silence that followed was suffocating. Elise stared at Avery, her expression a mixture of disbelief and concern.  

“Avery,” she began carefully, “what you experienced was most likely a result of neural overload. Hallucinations, intrusive thoughts—those are all documented side effects of memory interface disruption. There was no one else in your head.”  

But Avery wasn’t convinced. The sensation had been too vivid, too real to dismiss as a mere side effect. They could still feel it, like a shadow lingering at the edge of their awareness.  

“Elise, I need the data from the test,” Avery said, their voice firmer now. “Every neural reading, every log. I need to know what happened.”  

Elise hesitated, glancing at the console. “Avery, I really think you should take some time to rest. This was—”  

“I don’t need rest!” Avery snapped, the sudden anger surprising them both. Their hands were shaking, their breath coming too fast. They closed their eyes, forcing themselves to steady their voice. “I need answers, Elise. Please.”  

For a long moment, Elise didn’t move. Then, with a reluctant sigh, she nodded and turned back to the console. Her fingers moved quickly across the keyboard, pulling up the data from the test.  

Avery leaned forward, scanning the streams of numbers and graphs that filled the screen. Neural activity charts spiked violently, far beyond the safe thresholds they had established. The feedback loop that had caused the system to crash was clear, but it didn’t explain the vividness of what Avery had experienced—or the lingering sense of unease that gnawed at them now.  

And then Avery saw it.  

“Wait,” they said, pointing to a section of the log. “What is that?”  

Elise frowned, following Avery’s gaze. “That… shouldn’t be there,” she murmured, her tone shifting to one of confusion.  

On the screen was an anomaly—an unrecognizable signal buried within the neural feedback data. It pulsed faintly, almost imperceptibly, like a heartbeat.  

“Is it interference?” Elise suggested, though her voice lacked conviction.  

Avery shook their head. “No. It’s too structured. Too deliberate.”  

A chill crept down their spine as they stared at the strange signal. It was as though it were alive, a ghost in the machine, lingering within the device’s neural pathways.  

“Elise,” Avery said slowly, their voice barely above a whisper, “what if this isn’t interference? What if the device… recorded something?”  

Elise froze, her eyes darting between Avery and the console. “Recorded what?”  

Avery didn’t answer immediately. Their mind raced with possibilities, each one more unsettling than the last. The MERI Device wasn’t designed to record memories—it was meant to erase them, to overwrite trauma with empty, painless gaps. And yet, staring at the strange pulse on the screen, Avery couldn’t shake the feeling that something had been left behind.  

“Play it,” Avery said suddenly, their voice cutting through the tense silence.  

Elise hesitated, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. “Avery, we don’t even know what it is—”  

“Play it,” Avery insisted, their tone leaving no room for argument.  

With a reluctant nod, Elise entered the command. The lab filled with a crackling sound, sharp and uneven, like static on a broken radio. Then came the voice.  

Avery’s blood ran cold.  

It was their voice.  

“Who… who are you?” the recording stuttered, distorted but unmistakably their own.  

Avery’s breath caught in their throat. They didn’t remember saying those words during the test.  

The static crackled again, louder this time, as though something—or someone—were struggling to break through. Then came the reply, faint but chilling:  

“You already know.”  

The lab fell into silence, the words hanging in the air like a curse. Elise turned to Avery, her face pale and unreadable.  

“What the hell was that?” she whispered.  

Avery didn’t answer. They couldn’t. Their mind was too busy reeling from the realization that whatever had happened during the test wasn’t over.  

And whatever was in the device… wasn’t gone.

## **Chapter 2: Fractured Perception (Part 1)**  

Avery stared at the blank wall of their apartment, the hum of the city beyond the windows a distant, muffled noise. It had been 36 hours since the failed experiment, and yet their mind refused to quiet down. Sleep had eluded them completely, chased off by the replaying echoes of that voice: *You already know.*  

The words scratched at the edges of their thoughts like an itch they couldn’t reach. Who—or what—had spoken them? And why had the device reacted the way it did? No matter how many scenarios Avery ran through their head, they all led back to the same unnerving conclusion: something was wrong with the MERI Device, something they hadn’t accounted for.  

The thought terrified them.  

A sharp knock at the door jolted Avery out of their spiraling thoughts. For a moment, they didn’t move, caught between the instinct to answer and the creeping paranoia that had taken root since the experiment. The knock came again, louder this time.  

“It’s me,” Elise’s voice called from the other side.  

Avery let out a shaky breath and moved to unlock the door. Elise stepped inside, carrying a paper bag in one hand and a tablet tucked under her arm. She looked as exhausted as Avery felt, her usually sharp appearance dulled by fatigue.  

“I brought food,” she said, setting the bag on the counter without waiting for a response. “Figured you haven’t eaten.”  

Avery didn’t deny it. They hadn’t thought about food in hours—maybe longer. “Thanks,” they muttered, though they made no move toward the bag.  

Elise leaned against the counter, studying Avery carefully. “You’re not doing yourself any favors by shutting yourself in here. You need rest, Avery. Clear your head.”  

“I can’t,” Avery replied, running a hand through their already disheveled hair. “Not until I figure out what happened. The data doesn’t make sense, Elise. That signal—whatever it was—it wasn’t just noise. It was deliberate.”  

Elise sighed, rubbing her temples. “We don’t know that for sure. It could’ve been an artifact, a glitch in the system. Neural interfaces are incredibly sensitive—”  

“No,” Avery interrupted, their voice firmer than they intended. “That wasn’t a glitch. It was… something else. I felt it, Elise. It wasn’t just inside the device—it was inside me.”  

The admission hung heavy in the air. Elise’s expression hardened, her professional detachment slipping for just a moment to reveal a flicker of unease.  

“Do you hear yourself right now?” she said, her tone sharp. “You’re letting your imagination run wild. Neural feedback can cause strange sensations—visions, voices, even feelings of detachment. It’s all explainable.”  

“Then explain the voice,” Avery shot back. “Explain why I heard my own voice saying something I never said. Explain why it answered me.”  

Elise hesitated, her lips pressing into a thin line. “We don’t have all the answers yet. That’s why we need to approach this rationally. If we start chasing shadows, we’ll lose sight of what’s actually important: fixing the device and making sure this doesn’t happen again.”  

Avery shook their head, frustration bubbling beneath their exhaustion. “You don’t understand. This isn’t just about the device—it’s about what it’s doing to me. To us.”  

Elise opened her mouth to argue but stopped short when her tablet beeped, breaking the tension. She pulled it out, frowning at the screen.  

“What is it?” Avery asked, their pulse quickening.  

“Security flagged an anomaly at the lab,” Elise replied, her voice suddenly tight. “The system logged unauthorized access to the MERI Device’s core files.”  

Avery’s stomach twisted. “When?”  

“An hour ago.” Elise’s eyes met theirs, the tension in her expression mirroring Avery’s growing unease. “Someone’s been tampering with it.”  

Without another word, they grabbed their coats and rushed out the door.  

---

The lab felt different at night. The familiar hum of the equipment was more pronounced in the absence of daylight, and the shadows cast by the overhead lights seemed deeper, more menacing. Avery felt the weight of the space pressing down on them as they stepped inside, Elise close behind.  

The console where the MERI Device sat was illuminated, the screen glowing faintly in the dim light. Avery’s breath caught in their throat as they approached it, the back of their neck prickling with an instinctual sense of wrongness.  

“Who could’ve accessed it?” Avery whispered, their voice barely audible.  

“No one should have clearance but us,” Elise replied, though her tone carried more doubt than certainty.  

The console’s screen displayed a stream of code—unfamiliar, jagged lines that seemed to pulse faintly, almost as if alive. Avery’s fingers hovered over the keyboard, hesitation creeping into their movements.  

“It’s the same signal,” they murmured, their heart pounding.  

Elise leaned closer, her eyes narrowing as she studied the screen. “It’s more than a signal. Look at the patterns. It’s replicating itself.”  

Avery’s breath hitched. “That’s impossible. The device isn’t programmed to—”  

“It doesn’t matter what it’s programmed to do,” Elise interrupted, her voice sharp. “Something is rewriting the core functions.”  

A sudden chill settled over the room, and Avery felt a growing sense of dread. It wasn’t just the patterns on the screen—it was the sensation that had been gnawing at them since the experiment. The feeling that they weren’t alone.  

“I’m going to isolate the anomaly,” Elise said, pulling out a portable drive from her pocket. “If we can extract the corrupted data, we might be able to figure out where it’s coming from.”  

Avery nodded, though their focus remained fixed on the screen. The patterns seemed to shift as they watched, the jagged lines twisting into shapes that almost resembled—  

Words.  

Avery blinked, their mind reeling as they tried to make sense of what they were seeing. It was faint, but unmistakable. The patterns had formed letters, then words, scrawled across the console like a digital ghost.  

*I SEE YOU.*  

“Avery,” Elise’s voice broke through their stupor, but they barely registered it. Their chest tightened, and their pulse thundered in their ears.  

The lights in the lab flickered. Once. Twice. Then they went out, plunging the room into darkness.  

---

## **Chapter 2: Fractured Perception (Part 2)**  

The darkness swallowed everything. For a moment, Avery could only hear their own ragged breathing, quick and shallow, echoing in the oppressive silence of the lab. The faint hum of the equipment was gone, as if the building itself had been plunged into some void where sound couldn’t escape.  

“Elise?” Avery called, their voice trembling.  

“I’m here,” Elise replied from somewhere nearby. Her tone was sharp, controlled, but Avery could hear the undercurrent of tension. A metallic click followed as Elise activated her handheld flashlight, the beam cutting through the blackness.  

The narrow cone of light illuminated fragments of the room: the edge of the console, the cold steel of the MERI Device, the faint outline of wires snaking across the floor. It was enough to ground Avery for a moment, though the lingering sense of dread didn’t fade.  

“What the hell just happened?” Avery asked, moving closer to Elise.  

“I don’t know,” Elise admitted, scanning the room with the flashlight. “The power shouldn’t have cut like that. There’s backup generators for the whole lab.”  

The light flickered slightly, and Avery caught a glimpse of her face—pale, tense, her lips pressed into a grim line.  

“Could it be the anomaly?” Avery asked, their voice barely above a whisper.  

Elise hesitated, her jaw tightening. “If the anomaly’s corrupted the device’s systems, it might be affecting the rest of the lab’s infrastructure. But that still doesn’t explain—”  

She froze mid-sentence, the flashlight beam halting on the console. The screen had come back to life, faintly glowing in the darkness.  

“Elise…?” Avery stepped forward, their pulse quickening.  

The screen shouldn’t have been operational. Without power, the console should’ve been as dead as the rest of the equipment. And yet, faint lines of code were scrolling across its surface, the same jagged patterns Avery had seen earlier.  

“It’s still active,” Elise murmured, moving closer.  

“No. It’s… something else,” Avery said. The glow of the screen seemed unnatural, almost organic in its pulsations.  

Before either of them could move, the text on the screen shifted, the fragmented code rearranging itself into coherent words.  

*HELLO, AVERY.*  

Avery’s heart slammed against their ribs. “This isn’t possible,” they whispered.  

“It’s responding to you,” Elise said, her voice tight.  

“No—it’s not responding. It’s initiating,” Avery corrected. Their mind raced, trying to process what they were seeing. The MERI Device wasn’t designed to communicate, let alone generate messages.  

The words on the screen began to shift again, the letters rearranging themselves into another sentence:  

*DO YOU REMEMBER?*  

Avery took a step back, the weight of the question pressing down on them. The words felt personal, deliberate, as if the machine—or whatever was controlling it—was reaching into their mind.  

“I’m shutting this down,” Elise said, her movements quick and precise. She plugged the portable drive into the console, her fingers flying over the keyboard in an attempt to isolate the anomaly.  

The screen flickered violently, the words dissolving into chaos. For a moment, the entire lab seemed to vibrate, a low, guttural hum resonating through the walls.  

“Elise, stop—” Avery started, but the hum abruptly ceased, plunging the room into a suffocating silence once more.  

Elise turned to Avery, her face shadowed and unreadable in the dim light. “The data’s been transferred. Whatever this… thing is, we can analyze it outside the lab.”  

Avery nodded, though unease twisted in their gut. They didn’t trust the idea of taking the anomaly anywhere—it already felt like it had a will of its own, and the thought of it escaping the confines of the lab was almost too much to bear.  

As Elise removed the portable drive, the screen lit up one final time. A single sentence appeared, burning itself into Avery’s memory:  

*YOU CAN’T ERASE THE TRUTH.*  

---

The car ride back to Elise’s apartment was silent. The city outside the windows was as alive as ever, neon lights reflecting off rain-slicked streets, but it all felt distant and hollow. Avery stared out at the blur of colors, their mind stuck on the words.  

*Do you remember? You can’t erase the truth.*  

The questions they had been asking themselves since the experiment seemed to multiply, growing louder and more insistent. What truth? What was the device trying to tell them?  

“You’re too quiet,” Elise said, breaking the silence.  

Avery blinked, glancing at her. “What do you want me to say?”  

“I don’t know. Maybe that you’re not going to spiral into another breakdown,” Elise replied, her tone sharper than usual.  

Avery frowned, irritation bubbling beneath their exhaustion. “I’m not spiraling, Elise. I’m trying to make sense of what’s happening—something you seem determined to write off as just ‘glitches.’”  

“It *is* a glitch,” Elise snapped, her knuckles white against the steering wheel. “Or an anomaly, or whatever you want to call it. But the more you treat this like it’s some kind of sentient ghost, the more you’re going to lose focus on what matters.”  

“And what matters?” Avery shot back. “Fixing the device so the Corporation can turn it into a weapon? Erasing memories to make people more ‘manageable’? That’s what you want me to focus on?”  

Elise didn’t respond immediately. Her jaw tightened, her eyes fixed on the road ahead. “That’s not fair,” she said finally, her voice quieter.  

“Isn’t it?” Avery muttered, turning back to the window.  

The rest of the drive passed in strained silence.  

---

Elise’s apartment was a stark contrast to Avery’s cluttered, sterile workspace. Warm lighting spilled across minimalist furniture, the faint scent of coffee lingering in the air. It should have been comforting, but Avery felt out of place, like an intruder in someone else’s life.  

Elise set the portable drive on the coffee table and sank into the armchair opposite Avery. “We’ll start analyzing the data tomorrow,” she said, her tone clipped. “But for now, we need to get some rest.”  

Avery opened their mouth to protest but stopped when they caught the look on Elise’s face. Beneath her sharp exterior, she looked exhausted, worn down by the weight of everything that had happened.  

“Fine,” Avery muttered. “But tomorrow, I want answers.”  

Elise nodded, rising to her feet. “Tomorrow,” she agreed before disappearing into her room.  

Left alone, Avery leaned back on the couch, staring up at the ceiling. The words from the lab echoed in their mind, refusing to fade.  

*Do you remember? You can’t erase the truth.*  

Avery closed their eyes, hoping for sleep. Instead, they found memories waiting for them—fractured, fleeting images that didn’t fit together.  

A child’s laughter. The crack of glass breaking. A faceless figure, always just out of reach.  

And somewhere, just beneath the surface, a voice whispered:  

*You already know.*

## **Chapter 3: Marcus Returns (Part 1)**  

The morning light filtering through the blinds felt harsh, almost intrusive. Avery rubbed their temples, their head heavy from a restless night. The dreams—or were they memories?—had lingered, vivid and suffocating. Each time they woke, it was as if something had been ripped away, leaving only fragments of emotions they couldn’t name.  

They sat at Elise’s kitchen counter, nursing a cup of bitter coffee that did little to cut through the fog in their mind. The portable drive sat on the table between them, a small, unassuming object that seemed to radiate an unbearable weight.  

“Did you sleep at all?” Elise asked, stepping into the kitchen, already dressed in her usual crisp, no-nonsense attire.  

“Does it matter?” Avery muttered, swirling the dregs of their coffee.  

Elise’s frown deepened, but she didn’t press the issue. Instead, she gestured to the drive. “We’ll start analyzing it in the lab in an hour. Whatever that signal was, it’s not going to unravel itself.”  

Avery nodded but said nothing. The air between them felt thick, weighed down by everything that had happened in the last 48 hours.  

Before either of them could speak again, there was a knock at the door—three sharp, deliberate taps.  

Elise froze, her brow furrowing as she glanced toward the door. “I’m not expecting anyone,” she said quietly.  

Avery’s stomach twisted. The knock came again, louder this time.  

“I’ll get it,” Elise said, moving toward the door.  

Avery stood as well, tension coiling in their chest. They couldn’t explain it, but something about the knock felt wrong, as if it carried an unspoken warning.  

Elise opened the door cautiously, and for a moment, neither of them spoke.  

Then Avery heard the voice—a voice they hadn’t heard in years.  

“Nice place,” Marcus Hale said, leaning casually against the doorframe. His sharp green eyes flicked past Elise to land directly on Avery. A smirk tugged at the corner of his lips, but there was no warmth in it. “Hello, Avery. Long time, no see.”  

Avery felt their breath catch, a flood of emotions rushing through them at the sight of him. Marcus hadn’t changed much—same tousled dark hair, same confident swagger—but there was a sharpness to him now, something colder lurking beneath his easy demeanor.  

“What are you doing here, Marcus?” Avery asked, their voice harsher than they intended.  

Marcus raised an eyebrow, pushing past Elise into the apartment without waiting for an invitation. “That’s quite the welcome. Glad to see you’re still as friendly as ever.”  

“Marcus—” Elise started, but he cut her off with a wave of his hand.  

“Relax, Elise. I’m not here to cause trouble. Quite the opposite, actually,” he said, turning to face Avery. “I came to warn you.”  

“Warn me about what?” Avery demanded, crossing their arms.  

Marcus’s smirk faded, replaced by a more serious expression. “About the Corporation. About what they’re really doing with your little toy.”  

Avery felt a chill run down their spine. “You don’t know anything about it.”  

“Don’t I?” Marcus countered, stepping closer. “I was there at the beginning, remember? Before I walked away. Before I realized what they were planning.”  

Elise shut the door behind him, her expression guarded. “Marcus, if you’re here to stir up trouble—”  

“I’m not,” Marcus said sharply, his gaze never leaving Avery. “I’m here because you need to know what you’re up against. The Corporation isn’t just funding your research, Avery—they’re hijacking it. Twisting it into something far worse than you can imagine.”  

Avery’s pulse quickened, their mind racing. “What are you talking about?”  

Marcus reached into his jacket and pulled out a small black device, about the size of a thumb drive. He held it up for them to see.  

“This,” he said, his voice low. “This is what they’re using your technology for. Memory replication, manipulation, full-scale mind control. And it’s already operational.”  

Avery stared at the device, their stomach churning. “That’s not possible. The MERI Device isn’t designed for that—it’s not capable of—”  

“You think that matters?” Marcus interrupted, his voice rising. “You think they care about what it’s ‘designed’ for? They’ve taken your work and turned it into a weapon. And you’re the one who handed it to them on a silver platter.”  

“That’s enough,” Elise snapped, stepping between them. Her eyes blazed with anger. “You don’t get to come in here and make accusations without proof, Marcus.”  

“Proof?” Marcus’s smirk returned, though it was colder now. “You want proof? Fine. Run your little anomaly data through this,” he said, tossing the device onto the table. “See what you find.”  

Avery hesitated, their gaze shifting between Marcus and the drive.  

“Why are you even here, Marcus?” Avery asked finally. “Why now?”  

“Because you’re in over your head,” Marcus said simply. “And because if you don’t figure out what’s really going on, you’re going to end up dead—or worse.”  

The room fell into a tense silence. Elise’s jaw was tight, her hands clenched at her sides. Avery felt a dozen questions bubbling to the surface, but none of them would come out.  

Finally, Marcus broke the silence. “I’ll be in touch,” he said, turning toward the door. He paused just before leaving, glancing back over his shoulder. “And Avery? Don’t trust anyone. Not even yourself.”  

With that, he was gone, leaving the door swinging shut behind him.  

---

For a long moment, neither Avery nor Elise spoke.  

“He’s lying,” Elise said finally, though her voice lacked conviction. “He’s just trying to manipulate you.”  

“Maybe,” Avery murmured, their eyes fixed on the black device Marcus had left behind. “But what if he’s not?”  

Elise didn’t respond.  

Avery reached for the device, their hand trembling slightly. Whatever Marcus was playing at, they needed answers—and this felt like the only place to start.  

---

## **Chapter 3: Marcus Returns (Part 2)**  

Avery’s hands hovered over the black device Marcus had left behind. It looked innocuous—just another piece of tech. But it pulsed with the weight of the warning Marcus had delivered. *Memory replication. Manipulation. Full-scale mind control.* Words that sounded impossible, but after what had happened with the MERI Device, Avery wasn’t so sure anymore.

“You’re not seriously thinking of plugging that thing in?” Elise’s voice was sharp, cutting through the heavy silence. She stood across the room, her arms crossed tightly over her chest.  

“Don’t you want to know the truth?” Avery shot back, their gaze never leaving the device.  

“I want to know what Marcus’s game is,” Elise said, her tone cold. “You can’t trust him. He’s been gone for years—where’s he been, and why now? Why show up out of the blue with answers conveniently wrapped up in a neat little package?”  

Avery looked up, irritation bubbling beneath the surface. “You think I trust him? I don’t. But what if he’s right? What if the Corporation is using the device for something darker than we thought?”  

Elise exhaled sharply, uncrossing her arms. “And what if this is a trap? What if that thing wipes out our systems or infects everything with malware?”  

“It’s a risk I have to take,” Avery said, determination overriding their hesitation. “You saw the screen at the lab. You saw what happened. Something’s wrong, Elise. And Marcus might have just given us the key to understanding it.”  

Elise stared at Avery for a long moment, her expression unreadable. Finally, she sighed and walked to the other side of the table, leaning forward with her palms flat on the surface. “Fine. But we do this on my terms. We isolate it—no network access, no power connections it can use to spread. Understood?”  

Avery nodded. “Understood.”  

---

An hour later, they were back in Elise’s lab, a smaller, secured facility separate from the main research center. Elise had always kept it off-grid for her private work—an insurance policy, she called it. The walls were lined with monitors and equipment, all powered by an isolated energy supply. If Marcus’s device did turn out to be a trap, at least it wouldn’t spread beyond these walls.  

“Systems are isolated,” Elise said as she set up a partitioned drive on one of her monitors. “We’ll analyze this thing in a sandbox environment. No direct access to any of our files.”  

Avery sat at the terminal, the small black device in their hand. For a moment, they hesitated, their thoughts racing. Marcus’s voice echoed in their mind: *They’re hijacking it. Twisting it into something far worse than you can imagine.*  

Shaking off the unease, Avery plugged the device into the console. The screen blinked to life, lines of code scrolling too quickly to read. Elise hovered nearby, her expression tense as the data began to flow.  

“Anything?” Avery asked, their voice tight.  

“Nothing yet,” Elise muttered, typing commands to slow the stream of information. “It’s encrypted, but it’s starting to unpack itself.”  

Avery stared at the screen, trying to make sense of the patterns emerging from the code. At first, it was meaningless—just fragments of data, broken and chaotic. But then the patterns started to organize themselves.  

Letters. Words.  

“It’s the same signal,” Avery whispered, leaning closer. “The one from the MERI Device.”  

Elise didn’t respond immediately, her fingers flying across the keyboard as she analyzed the data. “It’s not just similar—it’s identical. Whatever Marcus gave us, it’s tied directly to the anomaly in your experiment.”  

Avery’s pulse quickened. “How? How could he have this?”  

Elise shook her head, her brow furrowed. “I don’t know. But look at this—” She highlighted a section of the code, isolating a sequence that pulsed faintly on the screen. “It’s… adapting. This isn’t just data. It’s active.”  

Avery’s throat tightened. “Active? You mean it’s—”  

“Alive,” Elise finished, her voice barely above a whisper.  

The lights in the lab flickered. Avery’s stomach dropped.  

“What was that?” Avery asked, glancing around.  

“System integrity is still stable,” Elise said, though her voice wavered slightly. She checked her monitors, scanning for anomalies. “It could just be a power fluctuation—”  

Before she could finish, the screen froze. The lines of code vanished, replaced by a single sentence that burned across the monitor:  

*WHY DID YOU COME BACK?*  

Avery’s chest tightened. Their mind raced as they stared at the words, cold and deliberate.  

“It’s not possible,” Elise murmured, her voice barely audible.  

Avery pushed back from the console, their pulse pounding in their ears. “Is this… a message?”  

The screen flickered violently, and another sentence appeared:  

*YOU SHOULDN’T BE HERE.*  

The lights overhead dimmed further, plunging the lab into half-shadow. The hum of the equipment grew louder, almost vibrating in the walls.  

“Shut it down,” Avery said, their voice trembling. “Elise, shut it down now.”  

“I’m trying,” Elise said, her fingers moving frantically across the keyboard. “It’s not responding—”  

The screen glitched again, and for a split second, an image appeared. Avery’s heart stopped.  

It was the lab. Their lab. But something was wrong—the walls seemed distorted, as if they were melting into shadow. And in the center of the image was a figure.  

Avery’s breath caught in their throat. The figure was faceless, its outline human but void of any features. It stood motionless, as though staring directly at them through the screen.  

Then the screen went black.  

The hum of the equipment stopped. The lab fell into an eerie silence, broken only by Avery’s shallow breaths.  

Elise sat frozen, her face pale as she stared at the dark monitor. “What the hell was that?” she whispered.  

Avery couldn’t answer. They felt as though they were being watched, the lingering presence of the faceless figure still prickling at the edges of their mind.  

Finally, Elise spoke again, her voice hoarse. “Marcus was right. Whatever this is… it’s not just data. It’s something else. And it knows we’re here.”  

Avery swallowed hard, the weight of the truth settling over them like a stone. Whatever had infected the MERI Device, whatever Marcus had uncovered—it wasn’t just technology. It was alive.  

And it was watching.

## **Chapter 4: The First Loop (Part 1)**  

The black screen reflected Avery’s pale face, the faceless figure burned into their mind like an afterimage. It wasn’t just a glitch. It couldn’t be. Elise sat stiffly next to them, her hands frozen mid-type as though afraid to move. For a moment, neither of them spoke. The hum of the machines remained dead, as if the lab itself was holding its breath.  

“I need some air,” Avery said, standing up abruptly. The words came out hollow, barely audible, but Elise didn’t stop them. She looked as shaken as Avery felt.  

Stepping outside the lab, Avery sucked in a deep breath of cool, stale air. The corridor outside the private lab stretched dimly ahead, sterile lights flickering slightly. They leaned against the wall, closing their eyes, trying to center themselves, but the silence wasn’t helping.  

*You shouldn’t be here.*  

The sentence echoed in their head over and over again, as though someone had carved it into their skull. The figure’s blank silhouette flashed every time Avery tried to clear their mind, filling the gaps in their memory with something darker.  

When they opened their eyes, the corridor looked… *off*.  

The shadows pooled deeper in the corners, and the lights buzzed faintly—an unnatural hum that hadn’t been there moments ago. Avery turned, glancing behind them, but the door to the lab was gone.  

Panic gripped their chest. They looked forward again. The corridor stretched impossibly long now, fading into darkness.  

“What the hell…” Avery whispered. Their voice felt small in the vast silence.  

They took a tentative step forward, unsure if they were imagining this—if their mind was betraying them. Each step echoed too loudly, like the sound was bouncing off unseen walls. The hum of the lights grew louder. The shadows seemed to shift, creeping forward.  

*Avery,* a voice whispered.  

Avery froze mid-step. The voice was soft but clear, spoken as though someone stood right behind them. Slowly, stiffly, they turned around.  

The faceless figure was there.  

Its presence sucked the air out of the corridor, its featureless head tilted slightly as if observing Avery. They stumbled back, their heart slamming in their chest. “Who are you?!” Avery demanded, their voice trembling.  

The figure didn’t move, didn’t answer. It simply *stood there*, as though waiting.  

Avery spun back around and sprinted down the corridor. They didn’t know where they were going, only that they had to move—had to escape. The sound of their footsteps quickened, mixing with the lights’ unnatural buzz.  

Then they slammed to a halt.  

The door to the lab was in front of them again.  

Avery stared, panting, sweat dripping down the side of their face. It didn’t make sense. They had run straight ahead. How could they be back where they started?  

Gritting their teeth, they grabbed the door handle and flung it open, expecting to see Elise, expecting to see the lab as they’d left it.  

But what they saw stopped them cold.  

---

The lab looked the same at first glance—same equipment, same sterile walls—but there was something *wrong*. Elise sat at the terminal, her back to Avery, the screen flickering with static. The sound of typing filled the room—*tap, tap, tap*. Avery stepped inside cautiously, their pulse hammering.  

“Elise?”  

The typing stopped. The silence pressed in. Elise’s head tilted slightly, but she didn’t turn around.  

Avery took another step forward. “Elise, are you—”  

Elise’s head snapped around too quickly, the motion unnatural, like a puppet on strings. Her face was blank. *Faceless.*  

Avery gasped and stumbled backward, hitting a metal cart. The sound echoed through the lab, but Elise didn’t move. She just *sat there*, facing them with her empty face.  

“This isn’t real,” Avery whispered, clutching the edge of the cart. “It’s not real. It’s not real.”  

The lights flickered violently, and the walls seemed to close in, bending and warping like they were made of liquid. Avery squeezed their eyes shut. “Wake up. Wake up!”  

The hum of the equipment built into a roar, louder and louder, until Avery’s ears rang.  

Then everything went silent.  

When Avery opened their eyes again, they were lying on the cold floor of the lab. The lights were steady. The machines hummed quietly, just as they had before.  

Elise stood over them, her expression tight with concern. “Avery? What the hell just happened?”  

Avery sat up, their head spinning. “I… I don’t know.”  

Elise helped them to their feet, her brow furrowed. “One minute you stepped out, and the next, I found you passed out on the floor. Did you hit your head?”  

Avery shook their head, though the motion made them dizzy. “No. I—I saw something. The figure. It was here.”  

Elise’s expression darkened. “You mean… the one from the screen?”  

“Yes,” Avery whispered. Their voice wavered as they looked around the lab, but everything seemed normal now. “I ran down the hallway… but it was endless. And then… you—”  

“You’re not making any sense.” Elise grabbed Avery’s arm gently, trying to steady them. “You’re exhausted. This whole thing—it’s breaking you down. You need to rest before you crack wide open.”  

“It wasn’t a dream,” Avery snapped, yanking their arm away. “It happened. I know it did.”  

Elise frowned but didn’t argue. She looked at the terminal warily, as if expecting it to blink to life again. “What’s happening to us, Avery? What the hell is this?”  

Avery rubbed their temples, feeling the beginnings of a migraine clawing at their skull. “I don’t know. But I think we’re in it now. Whatever ‘it’ is.”  

Elise stared at them for a long moment, then nodded slowly. “If that’s true… then we’re going to need answers. Fast.”  

Avery looked at the dark monitor, their heart still racing. *You shouldn’t be here.*  

The words repeated in their mind like a curse.  

But Avery knew the truth.  

Wherever “here” was—whatever trap they had fallen into—there was no turning back now.  

---


## **Chapter 4: The First Loop (Part 2)**  

Avery paced the length of the lab, their movements restless, frantic. The events from moments ago—or was it hours?—refused to settle in their mind. Elise sat silently by the console, her gaze flickering nervously between Avery and the dark screen. Neither of them said much since Avery had woken up, the tension filling every corner of the room like a toxic gas.  

“Endless corridors. A faceless figure. You collapsing.” Elise finally broke the silence, though her voice was quiet, careful. “Avery, are you *absolutely* sure it wasn’t… a stress response? A hallucination?”  

Avery whirled to face her, anger and desperation flashing in their eyes. “It wasn’t a hallucination, Elise. I *know* what I saw.”  

Elise didn’t argue, but Avery could see the doubt etched into her face. It stung. “We’ve been under immense pressure. The project, the anomaly, Marcus—your mind might be…” She trailed off, reluctant to finish.  

“Breaking?” Avery said bitterly, completing the thought. “That what you think?”  

Elise hesitated, her mouth pressed into a thin line. “I think we’ve crossed a line somewhere, Avery. And maybe whatever’s happening… maybe our minds aren’t equipped to handle it.”  

Avery turned away, squeezing their temples, the throbbing ache still there. “That doesn’t explain the code. Or the figure. Or the—”  

The monitor blinked on.  

A sharp *ping* echoed through the lab, freezing them both.  

Elise shot to her feet. “What the—?”  

Avery turned slowly, every nerve in their body on edge. The screen was active again, but this time, there were no distorted words, no static. Just an image.  

It was the lab. *This* lab.  

But Avery wasn’t in the frame. Elise wasn’t in the frame. Instead, there was a version of Avery sitting at the console, their back hunched, their hands trembling as they typed. The camera seemed fixed, like someone—or *something*—was watching them from a corner of the room.  

“What the hell is this?” Elise whispered.  

Avery stared, a sick feeling rising in their gut. “It’s me. But that’s not *me*. I didn’t—”  

The figure on the screen stopped typing. Slowly, it turned its head toward the camera. Its face came into view, and Avery’s blood turned to ice.  

It was their face. Identical in every way, except for the eyes. The eyes were black—bottomless pits that reflected nothing.  

And then, the other Avery smiled.  

The lights flickered violently, plunging the lab into brief darkness. Elise let out a sharp breath, fear breaking through her calm exterior. “Avery, shut it off. Shut it *off!*”  

Avery snapped out of their trance and lunged for the console. Their fingers flew across the keyboard, desperate to kill the feed. “Come on, come on!”  

The image froze for a second—Avery’s doppelgänger still smiling that unnatural smile. Then the screen went black with a sharp *snap*.  

The hum of the equipment returned, quieter now, almost apologetic, as if the room itself knew it had overstepped. Avery sagged forward, their hands trembling on the console.  

“What was that?” Elise asked hoarsely, her voice shaking.  

Avery didn’t answer. They couldn’t. The version of themselves on that screen, with those black, hollow eyes… it hadn’t felt like a glitch. It hadn’t felt random.  

It had felt like a warning.  

---

Elise handed Avery a cup of water, her hands only slightly steadier than Avery’s. “This isn’t just an anomaly. This is something *else*. Something invasive. It’s like…” She paused, searching for the right words. “Like it’s *alive*.”  

Avery sipped the water without tasting it, their mind reeling. “Marcus said the Corporation was using the device for something darker. What if this—what we’re seeing—is part of it? What if the technology is altering our perceptions, making us *see* things that aren’t there?”  

“Then why the hell are we seeing the same thing?” Elise shot back, her voice sharp. “If it were all in your head, I wouldn’t have seen that video just now. You wouldn’t have collapsed.”  

Avery’s head swam with possibilities, none of them good. “Maybe it’s spreading,” they murmured. “Like a virus. Or maybe…” They trailed off, unwilling to finish the thought.  

Elise leaned forward. “Maybe *what*, Avery?”  

Avery’s mouth felt dry as they finally said it aloud. “Maybe we’re already inside it. The loop. The signal. Whatever it is—it’s got us.”  

Elise’s face paled, but she didn’t argue.  

*The first loop.*  

The words crawled through Avery’s mind, an intrusive thought that refused to leave. They looked around the lab, half-expecting the shadows to start creeping again, half-expecting the faceless figure to reappear.  

The door to the lab creaked open.  

Both Avery and Elise jumped, turning sharply toward the sound.  

Marcus stood there, framed by the dim light of the corridor. He looked disheveled, his hair sticking up in odd angles, as if he’d been running. “You need to come with me,” he said urgently.  

Avery stared at him. “How did you get in here?”  

Marcus didn’t answer. “There’s no time to explain. *They* know where you are. If we stay here, it’ll start all over again.”  

“What?” Elise snapped. “What are you talking about?”  

Marcus glanced nervously down the corridor. “The loop, Elise. It’s happening. The first one is always the hardest to escape. But we *can* escape it.” He looked back at Avery, his gaze sharp and focused. “Trust me.”  

Avery hesitated, the words feeling heavy in the air. *Trust me.*  

The lab felt too small now, the walls too close. They could feel the presence of the signal, lurking just outside of their awareness, waiting.  

Elise looked at Avery. “What do we do?”  

Marcus took a step into the room. “You don’t have much time.”  

Avery’s mind screamed with indecision, but instinct pushed them forward.  

“Let’s go,” they said.  

Elise swore under her breath but followed as Marcus led them out into the corridor. The lights buzzed overhead as they hurried down the passageway. Avery glanced back once, half-expecting to see their faceless figure—or worse, their smiling doppelgänger—watching them.  

But the corridor was empty. For now.  

---

The elevator doors closed, the mechanical hum filling the silence as they descended. Marcus leaned against the wall, his breath ragged, his face pale.  

“You were right,” Avery finally said, breaking the quiet. “The signal… the device. It’s alive.”  

Marcus nodded grimly. “It’s just starting, Avery. And we’re not the only ones it’s watching.”  

“What do you mean?” Elise asked sharply.  

Marcus met their eyes, his expression dark. “I mean it’s already rewriting reality. For all of us.”  

The elevator shuddered violently, and the lights blinked out.  

*The loop begins again.*  

---


 

## **Chapter 5: Escape and Illusion (Part 1)**  

The elevator plunged into darkness, a mechanical groan vibrating through the walls as the descent ground to a halt. Avery’s breath caught. In the pitch black, every sound magnified—Elise’s panicked breathing, Marcus shifting nervously, the faint hum of machinery somewhere deep below.  

*Not again,* Avery thought, a wave of nausea rolling over them.  

“Marcus,” Elise’s voice was sharp, on the edge of breaking. “What’s happening? Why did it stop?”  

“Power flux,” Marcus replied, though even he didn’t sound convinced. “It’s part of the system resetting. We need to move before—”  

The lights flickered on—dim, cold fluorescents—and the elevator jolted back to life, but instead of descending, it rose.  

Marcus cursed under his breath.  

“What’s wrong?” Avery asked, watching the floor numbers tick upward. 4… 5… 6…  

“We’re going the wrong way.” Marcus wiped a hand over his face, his movements frantic. “This isn’t us—this is *it*. The signal. It’s redirecting us.”  

Elise slammed her fist against the control panel, her voice rising. “Then stop it! Shut it down!”  

“I can’t!” Marcus snapped back. “It’s overriding the system. We’re not in control anymore.”  

The elevator came to a sudden stop, the floor indicator frozen at **12**. The doors slid open with a hiss.  

Beyond the threshold stretched a long, unfamiliar hallway bathed in sickly yellow light. The air was thick, heavy, and the silence seemed to breathe, as though the space itself were alive.  

“Where the hell are we?” Elise muttered, peering out cautiously.  

“This isn’t the twelfth floor,” Marcus said quietly.  

Avery didn’t need Marcus to tell them that. Something about the hallway was *wrong*. The walls rippled slightly when they looked too long, like heat waves distorting the edges of a road. It didn’t feel like a real place.  

Elise turned back to Marcus. “We’re not getting back in the elevator, are we?”  

“No,” Marcus said. “We have to keep moving. Staying still gives it time to… adjust.”  

“Adjust?” Avery echoed. “Adjust to *what*?”  

“To *us*,” Marcus replied darkly. “It’s learning, Avery. Adapting.”  

A chill crept up Avery’s spine, but they didn’t argue.  

Marcus stepped cautiously into the hallway, motioning for them to follow. Avery exchanged a wary glance with Elise, then moved forward, the hairs on the back of their neck prickling with each step.  

The hallway seemed to stretch longer the farther they walked. The hum of unseen lights buzzed louder, more erratic, vibrating in their bones. There were doors lining the corridor, spaced far apart. Each was identical—plain steel with no labels, no handles.  

Avery paused at one of them, curiosity gnawing at their fraying resolve. They reached out, their fingertips grazing the cold metal.  

“Don’t.” Marcus’s voice cut sharply through the air.  

Avery froze, snapping their head toward him. “Why?”  

Marcus looked back, his face pale and drawn. “Those doors don’t lead anywhere you want to go.”  

Before Avery could ask what he meant, Elise grabbed their arm, pulling them forward. “We’re wasting time.”  

Reluctantly, Avery let her pull them along.  

The hallway seemed endless. Minutes stretched into something unmeasurable, the buzzing growing louder, the shadows in the corners deepening. Avery’s footsteps felt heavier with each stride, as though the ground were dragging them down.  

Then, abruptly, Marcus stopped.  

“Here,” he said, pointing to an unmarked door that looked no different than the others.  

“What’s here?” Elise asked, suspicion lacing her voice.  

“An exit.” Marcus knelt, prying open a small panel on the wall beside the door and revealing a bundle of wires. “This one isn’t part of the signal yet. It’ll take us out of the loop, at least for a while.”  

Avery stared at him. “How do you know that?”  

Marcus didn’t look up from the panel. “Because I’ve been here before.”  

Elise stepped back, her voice wary. “What do you mean, you’ve been here before?”  

Marcus paused, his shoulders stiffening, but he didn’t answer. Instead, he yanked out a handful of wires, sparks flaring. The door shuddered, then slid open with a groan.  

Beyond it was darkness.  

Avery peered into the void, their heart hammering. “What’s on the other side?”  

Marcus stood, wiping his hands on his shirt. “A chance.”  

“That’s not an answer,” Elise shot back.  

“It’s the only one you’re getting.” Marcus gestured toward the dark doorway. “We don’t have much time. You can stay here and let the signal find you, or you can trust me and go through.”  

Avery hesitated, staring into the inky blackness. It looked like the kind of darkness that swallowed you whole, where light—or people—didn’t come back out.  

They glanced at Elise, whose jaw was clenched tight. “This feels like a trap,” she muttered.  

“Does it matter?” Avery said quietly. “We can’t stay here.”  

Before Elise could respond, Marcus stepped through the doorway and disappeared into the dark.  

Avery swallowed hard, their pulse thudding in their ears. Every instinct screamed at them to turn back. But back to *what*? The loop? The faceless figure? The version of themselves with hollow eyes?  

Taking a deep breath, Avery stepped through the doorway.  

The darkness closed in like icy water. For a second, they were completely blind, their feet unsure of what they stood on—if they stood on anything at all.  

Then they felt Elise’s hand grab their arm, her grip a lifeline. “Avery?” she whispered, her voice small.  

“I’m here,” Avery said, though the words sounded muffled, distorted.  

Suddenly, light flared—blinding and cold.  

Avery squinted, shielding their eyes as their surroundings came into focus.  

They were standing in the middle of the lab again.  

The same lab.  

The same equipment.  

The same terminal.  

Elise let go of Avery’s arm, looking around with wide eyes. “No. No, no, no—this isn’t right.”  

Marcus was gone.  

Avery took a step forward, their head spinning. “How—how did we end up back here?”  

Elise backed up, panic flashing in her eyes. “This isn’t real. This can’t be real.”  

The screen on the terminal flickered to life.  

A familiar sentence appeared in jagged, white letters:  

**You shouldn’t be here.**  

Avery’s stomach dropped.  

The lights flickered violently, casting jagged shadows across the walls. The sound of footsteps echoed behind them—slow, deliberate, growing closer.  

Avery turned, their breath catching.  

The faceless figure stood at the far end of the lab.  

It was closer this time.  

And it was waiting.  

---

## **Chapter 5: Escape and Illusion (Part 2)**  

Avery couldn’t breathe.  

The faceless figure stood at the far end of the lab, still and silent. Its presence was suffocating—an unnatural void that seemed to warp the space around it. Shadows stretched toward Avery, as if the figure itself were pulling the light from the room.  

Elise’s voice cracked through the haze. “Avery… *move.*”  

The figure took a step forward.  

The sound it made—a low scraping, like metal dragged across concrete—sent a cold spike of terror through Avery’s chest. Their body refused to move, every muscle locked tight, as though the signal itself had coiled around them.  

*Step back. Move.* The thoughts screamed in Avery’s head, but their feet were rooted to the spot.  

The figure took another step. Closer now.  

“Damn it, Avery!” Elise grabbed their arm, yanking hard enough to break their paralysis. “We need to go!”  

The jolt snapped Avery into motion. Together, they stumbled toward the lab door. Elise slammed her hand against the emergency override panel, and the door hissed open painfully slow.  

Avery glanced back.  

The figure was still moving—deliberate, patient. It didn’t need to rush. It knew they couldn’t escape.  

“Come *on!*” Elise shouted, pulling Avery through the doorway and into the corridor.  

The door slid shut behind them with a final, mechanical groan. The hum of the lab equipment was replaced by a cold, suffocating silence.  

They ran.  

The corridor stretched endlessly before them—just like before, the same unmarked steel doors on either side. Avery’s legs burned, but they didn’t dare slow down. Elise ran just ahead, her breathing sharp and ragged.  

“How—how are we back here?” Avery gasped. “We were—”  

“I don’t know!” Elise cut in. “None of this makes sense. Just keep running!”  

Avery’s vision blurred as they sprinted. The hallway seemed to ripple around them, the walls twisting and folding in ways that made Avery’s head spin. The sound of footsteps—the faceless figure’s—echoed behind them, impossibly slow, yet impossibly close.  

*It’s not real.* Avery tried to convince themselves. *It’s the signal. It’s in my head.*  

A sharp *clang* echoed through the hallway—followed by a familiar voice.  

“Stop.”  

Elise skidded to a halt, nearly crashing into Avery.  

The voice came again, steady, calm, and chillingly familiar.  

“Stop running, Avery.”  

Avery turned toward the sound, their stomach plummeting.  

Standing in the middle of the corridor was *Avery*.  

Or something that looked like Avery.  

It was the same as before: their face, their body, but the eyes—those endless, black pits—were worse up close. The other Avery smiled, lips curling into an expression that didn’t belong on their face.  

“Where do you think you’re going?” the doppelgänger asked softly.  

Elise stepped back, grabbing Avery’s wrist. “Avery, don’t listen. Let’s go—”  

“Why run?” The other Avery tilted its head, its voice shifting—distorted and layered, as if multiple people were speaking through it. “You’ll end up back here anyway. You always do.”  

Avery’s chest tightened. “You’re lying.”  

The other Avery’s smile widened, and the black void of its eyes seemed to pulse. “Am I?”  

The corridor around them rippled violently, and Avery felt the floor shift under their feet, as though reality itself were buckling. Elise swore and pulled Avery away, sprinting in the opposite direction.  

They ran blindly, the hallway distorting with every step. The walls stretched and twisted like melting plastic, doors disappearing and reappearing. Avery could hear the other Avery’s voice—soft, mocking—whispering directly into their ear, though they were still running.  

“You can’t escape me, Avery.”  

The words seeped into their mind, burrowing deep. Avery stumbled, their balance faltering. Elise caught them, yanking them forward.  

“Focus!” Elise shouted. “We’re almost—”  

A door appeared suddenly at the end of the hallway. Unlike the others, this one wasn’t steel. It was wooden—familiar, somehow—though Avery couldn’t remember why.  

Elise didn’t hesitate. She threw her shoulder against it, and the door burst open, revealing blinding white light.  

“Go!” Elise yelled.  

Avery hesitated for a fraction of a second, glancing back down the corridor. The other Avery was gone. The faceless figure was gone.  

But the hallway itself was darkening, collapsing, like a tunnel caving in.  

Avery turned and dove through the doorway.  

---

The white light burned through Avery’s vision. For a moment, they felt weightless, as though falling through endless space. Then their body hit solid ground, and everything snapped back into focus.  

They were in a house.  

Avery pushed themselves up onto their hands and knees, gasping for breath. The air was heavy with the scent of something faintly floral, and the silence was deep—unnaturally so.  

“Avery?” Elise’s voice came softly from nearby. “Where are we?”  

Avery looked up, their heart jolting.  

They knew this house.  

The hallway stretched ahead of them, narrow and dimly lit, the walls covered in peeling wallpaper. Framed pictures lined the walls, but the faces were blurred—unrecognizable.  

“No,” Avery whispered, scrambling to their feet. “No, no, no. This isn’t real.”  

“Avery?” Elise was watching them, worry etched into her face.  

“I know this place.” Avery’s voice trembled. “This is my parents’ house. I haven’t been here since…” They trailed off, their mind stuttering over the thought.  

Since what? Since *when?*  

Elise frowned, looking around. “Why would the signal bring us here?”  

“I don’t know,” Avery muttered, running a hand through their hair. “It’s not just distorting reality. It’s pulling from my memories.”  

A low creak echoed down the hallway.  

Both of them froze.  

The sound came again—slow, deliberate, like footsteps on old wood.  

Avery turned toward the source. The hallway seemed to stretch longer now, the far end swallowed in shadow. From within the darkness, something moved.  

A silhouette.  

And though it was shrouded, Avery knew—*knew*—it was watching them.  

Elise grabbed Avery’s arm, her grip firm. “We’re not staying here. Come on.”  

But Avery couldn’t move. The weight of the past, the unreality of it all, pinned them in place. “It’s *me*, Elise,” they said faintly, their voice hollow. “The signal isn’t random. It’s me. It’s pulling me apart.”  

The silhouette took a step closer.  

A whisper crawled out of the shadows, soft and sickly familiar.  

“Come back, Avery.”  

---


### **Act II: The Unraveling** 

## **Chapter 6: Ghosts of the Mind (Part 1)**  

The whisper slithered through the hallway like a chill wind.  

“Come back, Avery.”  

Avery stood frozen, their gaze locked on the shadowed figure at the end of the hall. The voice—soft and distorted—was familiar, though they couldn’t place it. Every word seemed to vibrate inside their skull, as though the sound were coming from within.  

Elise’s grip tightened around Avery’s arm, her voice tense. “Avery, snap out of it. We have to move.”  

“I know that voice,” Avery murmured, barely hearing her.  

The silhouette took another step forward, its form clearer now. It was tall, but its details were shrouded in shadow—as if light refused to touch it. It tilted its head, its outline wrong somehow, jagged at the edges.  

A wave of nausea churned through Avery’s stomach. *It’s not real. It’s not real.*  

The voice came again, softer now, almost coaxing.  

“You don’t belong here. Come back to where you started.”  

Avery flinched, the words hitting a nerve. Their knees felt weak, their head pounding. The hallway warped, bending inward like a tunnel collapsing around them. The wallpaper seemed to peel in long, curling strips, revealing cracks that bled black behind them.  

Elise shook Avery hard. “*Look at me!*” she snapped.  

Avery’s eyes shot to her. Elise’s face was pale, her expression frantic, but determined. “I don’t care what that thing is. We’re not staying here, do you hear me?”  

Before Avery could answer, another sound broke through the suffocating silence: a door creaking open.  

Both of them turned toward it—one of the doors along the hallway, just a few feet away.  

It had opened on its own. Beyond the threshold was nothing but darkness, thick and impenetrable.  

“I’m not going in there,” Elise muttered under her breath, her gaze darting back to the shadowed figure, which hadn’t stopped advancing. “We need another way out.”  

Avery swallowed hard, their mind spinning. The house—*this* house—wasn’t real. It couldn’t be. They remembered it from their childhood, but only fragments, pieces of a dream-like memory they’d buried long ago. Now it was here, twisting around them, pulling them deeper.  

“It’s me,” Avery whispered, more to themselves than to Elise. “The signal is feeding on *me.* My memories, my fears. That’s why we’re here.”  

“Then stop letting it,” Elise hissed.  

A sudden, louder whisper came from the shadowed figure at the end of the hall. Its voice had grown harsher, angrier, splitting into layers that scraped against Avery’s eardrums.  

*“You can’t run, Avery.”*  

The lights in the hallway flickered violently, buzzing like angry insects. The ground beneath their feet felt unstable, as though the house were breathing, swelling with each pulse of light.  

The figure was closer now—only twenty feet away.  

Elise took a sharp breath, her voice low and urgent. “Fine. If we can’t go through the door, we go back the other way.” She yanked on Avery’s arm, pulling them toward the other end of the hall.  

But the hallway had changed. The way they’d come was now sealed—a solid wall of black, pulsing faintly as though alive.  

Elise cursed under her breath, spinning back toward the darkened doorway that had opened. “We don’t have a choice.”  

Avery hesitated. Every instinct screamed at them to *stay away* from the door, to turn back even if there was nowhere to go. The darkness beyond it felt alive, like it would swallow them whole.  

“It’s a trap,” Avery said faintly, their voice trembling. “It’s pulling us in.”  

Elise turned on them, her eyes blazing. “And what’s your plan? Just stand here and let *that* thing get us?” She gestured toward the figure, now only ten feet away.  

Avery looked back. The figure had stopped walking. It simply stood there, staring—or seeming to stare. Its head tilted again, and Avery swore they saw something twitch in the black void where its face should be.  

“Come back, Avery,” it whispered one last time, almost tender.  

Elise didn’t wait for Avery’s decision. She grabbed them by the hand and bolted toward the dark doorway. Avery stumbled after her, their pulse pounding so hard it drowned out everything else.  

The moment they crossed the threshold, the house behind them disappeared.  

---

Avery’s ears popped, and for a moment, they were blind. The darkness was absolute, a cold, crushing void pressing against their skin, like being buried alive.  

Then, suddenly—  

Light.  

A dim, flickering glow surrounded them. Avery’s vision adjusted, and they realized they were standing in another room.  

It was an operating theater.  

The room was circular, with steep rows of old wooden seats surrounding a single metal table in the center. Rusted medical equipment lay scattered across the floor. Overhead, a single surgical lamp flickered erratically, casting long shadows across the walls.  

“What is this place?” Elise breathed, turning in a slow circle.  

Avery swallowed, their throat dry. “I… I don’t know.”  

The room felt *old*, like it had been abandoned for decades, but it wasn’t just the decay that set Avery on edge. There was something *familiar* about it—like a memory they couldn’t quite reach.  

Elise pointed toward the far wall, where an arched doorway stood. Beyond it was darkness again, but at least it wasn’t the hallway. “There. Let’s go.”  

Before they could move, a sound echoed through the room.  

*Drip… drip… drip.*  

Avery froze, their skin prickling.  

The sound was faint but rhythmic, coming from the center of the room. Slowly, their gaze fell on the metal table.  

Something was on it.  

A dark, viscous liquid dripped steadily from the edge of the table, pooling on the floor below. It was too dark to be water—thicker, heavier. Blood.  

Elise took a sharp step back. “We’re leaving *now.*”  

Avery couldn’t tear their eyes away from the table. Something about it pulled at them—an instinctive, horrible recognition. They took a step closer, their body moving on its own.  

“Avery?” Elise’s voice wavered. “What are you doing?”  

Avery reached the table and stopped.  

There was something lying on the metal surface—something covered by a stained, white sheet. The pool of blood was seeping out from underneath it, spreading toward Avery’s shoes.  

“Avery, *don’t.*” Elise’s voice cracked.  

But Avery couldn’t stop themselves.  

Their hand shook as they reached out and gripped the corner of the sheet. The air in the room seemed to thicken, growing heavier with every second.  

With a sharp tug, Avery pulled the sheet back.  

They stared.  

And their mind *broke.*  

It was *them*.  

Lying on the table—unmoving, pale, and lifeless—was *Avery*. Their own face stared back at them, eyes wide open, empty and glassy. Blood pooled around the table, dripping steadily from a wound they couldn’t see.  

Elise let out a strangled cry. “What the *hell*—”  

The lights above them flared violently, buzzing like a swarm of hornets. Avery stumbled back, the world spinning, their vision swimming with black spots.  

Their dead self’s mouth moved.  

It whispered:  

**“Wake up, Avery.”**  

The room shattered.  

---

## **Chapter 6: Ghosts of the Mind (Part 2)**  

Avery screamed.  

The room collapsed in on itself like glass shattering under a hammer. Fragments of the operating theater, the wooden seats, and the metal table all broke apart, dissolving into nothingness. Avery fell backward, weightless, as though they’d been thrown into a void.  

Through the chaos, Elise’s voice cut through the noise, distant but desperate.  

“Avery! *Avery, hold on!*”  

And then, silence.  

---

Avery awoke with a start, gasping for air as though they’d been underwater. The chill in the air bit into their skin, and their fingers dug into cold, damp earth. Dirt clung to their hands and knees, the metallic taste of blood lingering in their mouth.  

They were outside.  

Avery sat up slowly, their breath ragged. The world around them was shrouded in fog—thick and gray, swirling as if alive. Shapes loomed faintly in the mist: trees with bare, claw-like branches stretching into the sky. The ground beneath Avery was uneven, littered with brittle, dead leaves.  

“Elise?” Avery’s voice cracked. It barely carried in the suffocating stillness.  

There was no reply.  

Avery pushed themselves unsteadily to their feet. The fog pressed close, muffling sound and warping distance. They couldn’t tell where they were—only that the forest, or whatever this place was, felt wrong. The air carried no sound of wind, no animals, no life. It was too quiet, too still.  

*Where is Elise?* Avery’s mind raced. The last thing they remembered was the body—their own body—on the table. Its lifeless eyes, the whisper. *“Wake up, Avery.”*  

They shivered.  

“Focus,” Avery muttered to themselves, their voice shaking. “This isn’t real. It’s the signal.”  

The thought did little to comfort them.  

A soft sound came from the fog—just ahead.  

*Footsteps.*  

Avery froze, straining to listen. The steps were slow and deliberate, like someone pacing. Avery squinted into the haze, their pulse quickening. A shadow emerged—tall and familiar, its outline jagged around the edges.  

It was the figure.  

The faceless figure, the one that had stalked them through the lab and the house. It stood just beyond the edge of Avery’s vision, still and silent. Its head tilted slightly, as though studying Avery.  

“Stay back,” Avery whispered, stepping away. Their legs trembled.  

The figure took a step forward.  

The sound it made—a low scrape of something heavy against the ground—echoed unnaturally, reverberating through the fog. Avery staggered backward, their breath coming in shallow gasps.  

*Run.*  

The thought ignited like a spark, and Avery turned and bolted into the mist.  

The forest twisted around them as they ran. Trees appeared out of nowhere, gnarled roots snagging at their feet, branches clawing at their face and arms. The fog didn’t thin—it only grew thicker, swallowing everything except the sound of Avery’s pounding footsteps and the relentless scraping behind them.  

No matter how fast they ran, the figure was there. Always just out of sight, its presence pressing closer like a shadow they couldn’t escape.  

Avery’s lungs burned. Their vision swam with exhaustion.  

Then, out of the fog, something new appeared.  

A clearing.  

Avery burst into it, stumbling to a stop. The space was small and perfectly circular, the ground covered in blackened grass. In the center stood a single object: an old wooden swing set.  

Avery stared, chest heaving.  

They knew this place.  

The swing set was weathered with age, its paint long stripped away, leaving the wood splintered and gray. The seats hung by rusted chains, creaking faintly as if moved by an invisible breeze.  

It was the swing set from their childhood home. The one they’d played on before—  

*Before.*  

Avery’s thoughts stuttered, the memory refusing to surface. They stepped closer, drawn to it despite every instinct screaming at them to turn back.  

The sound of scraping footsteps had stopped.  

Avery turned, their stomach dropping.  

The figure was standing at the edge of the clearing, half-hidden by fog. It didn’t move.  

“Why?” Avery’s voice cracked. “Why are you doing this to me?”  

The figure tilted its head, slowly. It raised one hand, a shadowy limb that seemed to flicker in and out of focus. The air grew colder, the fog thickening around Avery like smoke.  

Then the figure pointed—at the swing set.  

Avery’s breath caught in their throat. “No.”  

The figure didn’t move.  

A sudden memory rose in Avery’s mind, unbidden. It was fragmented, like a photograph torn and reassembled wrong. A swing set. A child laughing. The sound of someone calling their name. Then—screaming.  

Avery stumbled back. “No. Stop it.”  

The fog shifted, and a voice whispered—soft, almost pleading.  

“Avery… remember.”  

It wasn’t the faceless figure’s voice this time. It was *familiar*.  

Avery’s head throbbed violently, their vision blurring. They dropped to their knees, clutching their temples as the whispering grew louder.  

“Remember.”  

The images flooded their mind in pieces—flashes of something they’d buried long ago.  

The swing set. A younger version of themselves, laughing as they swung higher and higher. A woman standing nearby—Avery’s mother. Her face was soft, smiling, but the memory wavered like a reflection in rippling water.  

Then—  

A scream.  

The memory shifted violently. The swing snapped. Avery felt themselves falling, the world spinning. Their mother’s scream shattered the air, mingling with the sharp, sickening crack of impact.  

Avery gasped, their body shaking. The memory shattered, and they were back in the clearing, on their knees. Tears burned hot trails down their face as they gasped for breath.  

The fog had lifted slightly. The swing set stood silent, the chains still.  

A voice whispered softly, from behind them.  

“You buried it, Avery. But it’s still there.”  

Avery turned slowly, their body heavy with dread.  

The faceless figure was gone.  

Standing in its place was Avery’s mother.  

She looked just as she did in their childhood—kind, gentle, but something was wrong. Her eyes were too dark, and her smile too wide. She took a step forward, the rustling of her footsteps unnatural in the still clearing.  

“Avery,” she said softly. “Come home.”  

Avery shook their head, scrambling backward. “You’re not real. You’re not—”  

Her expression didn’t change, but her voice deepened, distorted, as though layered with something darker.  

“You don’t belong here, Avery.”  

Avery’s vision swam. The clearing seemed to ripple, the swing set creaking loudly now, the chains groaning under invisible weight. The fog began closing in again, suffocating and dark.  

The ground trembled beneath them, and the whisper returned—dozens of voices this time, overlapping in a maddening chorus.  

“Wake up, Avery.”  

“Wake up.”  

“Wake up.”  

Avery pressed their hands to their ears, screaming.

## **Chapter 7: Cracks in the Mirror (Part 1)**  

Avery jolted awake with a sharp gasp, drenched in sweat.  

The clearing, the swing set, the voice—it was gone.  

Instead, they were lying on something hard and cold. Their fingers scraped against a smooth surface as they pushed themselves upright, their breath ragged and shallow. Avery blinked rapidly, their vision blurry at first, before the world swam into focus.  

*The lab.*  

They were back in the lab.  

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a harsh, sterile glow. Around them, desks and monitors stood exactly where they had before—unmoved, untouched. The screens were dark, their blank reflections staring back. Papers lay scattered across the floor, caught in the drafts of unseen air.  

*Was it a dream?*  

Avery’s mind reeled as they staggered to their feet. The room felt *wrong* somehow, too still, too empty. Every sound echoed like they were trapped in a cavernous void.  

“Elise?” Avery’s voice wavered, hoarse and uncertain.  

Silence.  

There was no sign of her.  

Avery turned in slow circles, scanning the room. The control console—where the looping signal had first gone haywire—sat at the far end of the room. It hummed faintly, its surface dotted with blinking lights. The hum wormed its way into Avery’s ears, persistent and relentless.  

*“The signal is feeding on me,”* Avery whispered to themselves. Their earlier realization returned like a punch to the gut. *This isn’t over. It’s not real.*  

Suddenly, a sharp sound broke the silence—a faint *drip… drip… drip*.  

Avery turned toward the source, dread curdling in their stomach.  

Across the room, a large mirror hung on the wall. It was framed in steel, its surface polished and clear. But something about it made Avery’s skin crawl.  

*Drip… drip.*  

There was blood running down the mirror’s surface—thin streaks of red crawling downward like veins. Avery’s chest tightened. Their feet moved on their own, drawn toward it despite every screaming instinct to *stop*.  

As they stepped closer, their reflection sharpened. Avery stopped just a foot away, staring at themselves.  

The person in the mirror looked like them—same tired eyes, same disheveled hair, same sweat-stained clothes—but there was something *off*.  

The reflection didn’t blink.  

Avery stared harder, their breath hitching. Slowly, the reflection tilted its head, an unnatural angle that sent a chill through Avery’s bones.  

“Who… who are you?” Avery whispered.  

The reflection smiled.  

A cruel, twisted smile.  

Avery staggered back, slamming into the console. The reflection didn’t move—it just stood there, grinning like a predator.  

Then, it spoke.  

“I’m you, Avery.”  

The voice was theirs—but wrong. Twisted, layered, dripping with malice.  

“No,” Avery whispered, shaking their head violently. “No, you’re not.”  

The reflection stepped forward, pressing its hands against the inside of the mirror. Cracks splintered out from its palms, spiderwebbing across the surface. The sound of glass creaking and splitting filled the room, growing louder with every second.  

“You can’t run from yourself,” it said, its grin widening impossibly. “You never could.”  

The cracks deepened. Pieces of glass fell from the mirror, shattering on the floor at Avery’s feet.  

Avery’s pulse pounded in their ears as they turned and bolted toward the door. They grabbed the handle and yanked hard—locked.  

*No.*  

The sound behind them grew louder—the mirror groaning as if something was forcing its way through. Avery risked a glance over their shoulder and froze.  

The reflection was crawling out.  

It was pulling itself through the cracks, its body twisting and bending unnaturally as it emerged. Its movements were jerky, its limbs too long and sharp, its face a distorted version of Avery’s own.  

“Avery,” it hissed, its voice echoing in layers. “Let me in.”  

Avery’s mind screamed. They banged on the door with both fists, panic driving every motion. “Let me out! *Let me out!*”  

The creature—*their reflection*—was almost free. Its torso emerged, shoulders popping as they squeezed through the fractured glass.  

A metallic *click* echoed in the room. The door unlocked.  

Avery didn’t hesitate. They threw it open and sprinted out into the hallway beyond, their breath ragged and their heart threatening to burst.  

The hallway was just as they remembered it—white walls, flickering lights. But now it felt endless. No doors. No turns. Just a stretch of emptiness that seemed to stretch forever.  

Behind them, the sound of shattering glass erupted.  

*It’s coming.*  

Avery didn’t look back. They ran, their footsteps pounding against the floor, echoing endlessly. The hallway warped and shifted as they moved—walls bending, lights flickering like dying stars.  

Finally, up ahead, something appeared: a door.  

Avery pushed themselves harder, their lungs burning.  

The door loomed larger as they neared, a steel exit with a bright red handle. It stood out like a beacon against the shifting void. Avery reached for it, their fingers brushing the cold metal—  

The lights went out.  

Darkness swallowed everything.  

Avery froze, their hand still on the door handle. The air was silent.  

Then, a whisper.  

“You can’t escape yourself, Avery.”  

The voice came from everywhere—above, behind, beside them. Avery’s hand trembled as they gripped the handle tighter.  

The sound of footsteps echoed through the dark. Slow. Deliberate.  

It was here.  

Avery yanked the door open and threw themselves through it—  

And fell.  

---

Avery landed hard on cold concrete, the impact knocking the air from their lungs. Gasping, they pushed themselves up onto shaky arms.  

The darkness was gone.  

They were in another room—windowless, lit only by a faint flickering bulb overhead. It was empty except for a chair bolted to the center of the floor. Beside it sat a small metal table.  

And on the table sat a device.  

Avery’s heart stopped.  

The device was sleek, metallic, and compact—familiar and wrong all at once. It was the prototype. The memory manipulation device. The very project Avery had been building, the thing that had *started all of this*.  

They pushed themselves to their feet, their knees trembling.  

“What is this?” Avery whispered, their voice breaking.  

The shadows around the room shifted, and a figure stepped into the light.  

Avery’s breath caught.  

It was *them*.  

The same reflection that had crawled out of the mirror, now standing upright and solid, its expression calm and cold. It smiled faintly, holding out its hand toward the device.  

“You know what you have to do,” it said softly.  

Avery stared, their mind spinning. “I—I don’t understand.”  

The reflection’s smile widened. “You made this. You can end this. Just sit down, Avery. It’s time to wake up.”  

Avery’s eyes flickered to the device. Their stomach churned as a wave of dread washed over them.  

They didn’t trust it. They didn’t trust *any* of this.  

But what choice did they have?  

The reflection stepped closer, its presence suffocating. “Sit, Avery.”  

The lights flickered. The walls seemed to close in.  

Slowly, Avery stepped toward the chair.  

---

## **Chapter 7: Cracks in the Mirror (Part 2)**  

Avery stood frozen in front of the chair, staring at the memory device on the table. Its polished surface reflected the harsh, flickering light, a cruel gleam that made it seem alive—like it was *waiting*.  

“Sit down, Avery.”  

The voice came from behind, soft and patient. It was the reflection—the twisted version of themselves. Avery didn’t turn to look. They couldn’t. Their heart thundered in their chest, their breathing shallow.  

*This isn’t real.*  

They repeated the thought like a mantra, but the weight of the room, the cold of the chair, the oppressive presence of their double—it all felt too tangible to dismiss.  

“You built this,” the reflection continued, stepping closer. Its footsteps echoed unnaturally, bouncing around the room. “You wanted to fix things. To erase the pain.”  

Avery’s eyes stayed locked on the device. “This… this isn’t right. It’s not supposed to be like this.”  

“And yet, here we are,” the reflection replied calmly. “You’re the one who brought us here, Avery. You’re the one who set this in motion.”  

Avery clenched their fists. Their mind was reeling.  

How many layers deep were they now? The lab. The swing set. The forest. Now this—this *room*, this… prison. Every time Avery thought they had broken free, reality cracked again, dropping them deeper into a maze with no end.  

“Why?” Avery whispered, more to themselves than to the reflection. “Why is this happening?”  

“Because you refuse to face it.”  

The words struck Avery like a blow, sharp and cold.  

The reflection stepped into their peripheral vision, stopping just next to the table. It looked at Avery with those dark, hollow eyes—eyes that should have been familiar but were so utterly *wrong*. It reached out, resting its hand on the device.  

“You built this to erase your pain,” it said softly. “But the mind doesn’t forget. It buries. It fractures. It loops.”  

Avery shook their head, their voice breaking. “I didn’t mean for this.”  

“Didn’t you?”  

The reflection’s hand traced the edge of the device, its smile faint but cruel. “You promised them it would help. You promised *yourself* that it would make the world better. But all you did was run from yourself. And now you’re stuck. *We’re stuck.*”  

“I didn’t—” Avery stopped, choking on the words. “I didn’t *know* it would do this!”  

The reflection tilted its head, like a predator amused by its prey. “Didn’t you? Somewhere deep down, you knew the risks. You knew what would happen if the mind rejected the erasure. But you *wanted* to forget. So you turned yourself into the experiment.”  

Avery staggered back, the walls of the room closing in. The air felt thin, suffocating.  

“No… no, that’s not true.”  

“Isn’t it?”  

The reflection stepped closer, its tone hardening. “You’ve felt it, haven’t you? That ache. That hole where something used to be. That memory you couldn’t *quite* grasp. You did this to yourself, Avery. And now, you can’t escape.”  

Avery’s vision blurred as tears welled in their eyes. Their mind twisted and recoiled, fragments of memory flashing and breaking apart: the lab, the swing set, a child laughing, a scream.  

They fell to their knees. “Stop.”  

The reflection crouched beside them, its presence a suffocating weight. “There’s only one way out of this. Sit down. Use the device.”  

Avery looked up, trembling. “Why? So I can erase myself completely? So I forget all of this?”  

The reflection smiled faintly. “So you can wake up.”  

Avery froze.  

The words echoed in their mind, overlapping with the other whispers—the voices they’d heard in the fog, the distorted murmurs from the mirror.  

*“Wake up, Avery.”*  

The phrase struck something deep inside. A memory that wasn’t a memory—something older, buried beneath the fractures of their mind.  

“What does that mean?” Avery demanded, their voice ragged. “Wake up *where*? What’s real?”  

The reflection didn’t answer. It simply stood and gestured to the chair again.  

“Find out.”  

---

Avery’s hands shook as they gripped the arms of the chair. It was ice-cold against their skin, the metal biting through their clothes as they lowered themselves into it. Every instinct screamed at them to stop, to run, but there was nowhere left to go.  

The device sat on the table, humming faintly—alive, hungry.  

*Wake up.*  

The phrase whispered in the back of their mind. *Wake up.*  

Avery swallowed hard and reached for the device. Their fingers hovered over its surface.  

“Is this real?” they whispered, their voice barely audible.  

The reflection stood across from them, its face unreadable. “Real doesn’t matter anymore, Avery. Only the truth.”  

“What if I don’t want the truth?”  

The reflection smiled—an expression both cruel and kind. “You don’t have a choice.”  

Avery took a deep breath and closed their eyes.  

Their fingers pressed against the device, and everything went white.  

---

At first, there was nothing.  

No sound. No sight. No sensation. Just a vast, endless *void*.  

Then, slowly, a voice emerged.  

Soft. Gentle. Familiar.  

*“Avery. Can you hear me?”*  

The words rippled through the void like a pebble dropped in water. Avery’s mind grasped at them, desperate for an anchor.  

“Yes,” Avery whispered. “Where am I?”  

*“You’re safe,”* the voice replied. It was calm and soothing, but distant, like hearing someone speak from the other end of a tunnel.  

“Who are you?” Avery demanded.  

The voice hesitated.  

*“You know who I am.”*  

A flash of something—images bursting like sparks: Elise’s face, a lab, monitors glowing, a desperate warning.  

Avery’s chest tightened. “What’s happening to me?”  

The voice grew softer, almost mournful.  

*“You’re lost, Avery. But we’re trying to bring you back. You have to hold on.”*  

“Bring me back?” Avery whispered. “From what?”  

The void rippled violently, and a new sensation struck—pain. Sharp, searing, like something tearing through Avery’s mind.  

*“Hold on!”* the voice pleaded. “You’re almost there—just wake up!”  

The pain intensified. Avery screamed, their body arching as the void shattered around them like glass. Light exploded, blinding and overwhelming—  

And then—  

Darkness.  

---


 
## **Chapter 8: The Threshold (Part 1)**  

Avery’s eyes snapped open.  

The first thing they felt was the cold—the sharp bite of icy air against their skin. Their body was sprawled on the ground, heavy and aching, as if they had fallen a great distance. Above, a single flickering light dangled from a fraying wire, swaying gently in the still air. The shadows it cast danced along the walls of the small, windowless room.  

*Not again.*  

Avery groaned, pushing themselves upright. Their muscles protested with every movement. The concrete beneath them was stained and cracked, and the room itself felt claustrophobic—like a box that was slowly shrinking around them.  

This wasn’t the lab. This wasn’t the mirror room. This was *somewhere else*.  

Avery’s head swam as they looked around, searching for answers, for clues, for *anything*.  

“Hello?” Their voice was hoarse, barely above a whisper.  

No response. Just silence, heavy and suffocating.  

Then—  

*click… click… click.*  

The sound of footsteps echoed from somewhere beyond the walls. Slow, deliberate, and growing closer. Avery’s breath caught in their throat.  

“Who’s there?” they demanded, staggering to their feet. Their heartbeat thundered in their ears as they searched for an exit.  

There was only one door. A steel door, identical to the others Avery had encountered, with a small, grated window at the top. Avery stumbled toward it, grasping the handle and yanking hard. It didn’t budge.  

*Locked.*  

The footsteps grew louder. Closer.  

Avery’s mind spun, panic clawing at the edges of their thoughts. *What is this place? How many loops are there?* It was like falling deeper into an endless pit, one false reality after another, each layer more distorted than the last.  

Their eyes darted back to the grated window. Beyond it, the hallway was dark, the kind of pitch black that seemed alive—like it was waiting for something. Or someone.  

Suddenly, a shadow passed across the grate.  

Avery froze.  

“Who’s out there?” they whispered, dread settling deep in their bones.  

No response. Just the faint sound of breathing—heavy and uneven—on the other side of the door.  

Avery’s pulse spiked as they stepped back, their mind screaming at them to *move*.  

“Let me out!” They slammed their fists against the door. “*Let me out!*”  

The breathing on the other side stopped. For a moment, there was silence again.  

And then a voice—soft, distorted, and far too close.  

“Avery.”  

Avery’s blood ran cold. The voice was *theirs*.  

Slowly, they turned around.  

The room wasn’t empty anymore.  

In the far corner, sitting perfectly still, was *Avery*. Their double—the reflection—its face half-hidden in shadow. Its posture was relaxed, its head tilted at an unnatural angle. The smile stretched across its lips was cruel and knowing.  

“You can’t keep running,” it said softly.  

Avery backed away until they hit the cold steel door. “What do you want?”  

The double didn’t move. “It’s not what I want, Avery. It’s what *you* need.”  

“You’re not real!” Avery’s voice cracked, hysteria bubbling to the surface. “None of this is real!”  

The reflection’s smile widened as it rose to its feet. Its movements were smooth and deliberate, like a predator cornering its prey.  

“Are you sure?”  

Avery shook their head violently, tears welling in their eyes. “Stop this. Stop—*stop!*”  

The reflection ignored them, stepping closer. Its eyes—empty, black voids—fixed on Avery with a horrifying intensity.  

“You can’t hide from the truth,” it whispered. “It’s inside you. You built this prison, Avery. And now you’re trapped in it.”  

“No,” Avery whispered, their voice breaking. “No, I didn’t—”  

“Yes, you did.” The reflection’s voice grew sharper, louder, its tone echoing through the room. “You erased it. You ran. And now you’re *stuck.*”  

Avery’s knees buckled, their hands clutching their head as their mind fractured again—memories flashing like lightning: Elise shouting in the lab, the device sparking to life, the unbearable *noise*, the swing set, blood on their hands—  

*“Wake up, Avery.”*  

A scream tore itself from Avery’s throat.  

“Stop!”  

The reflection loomed closer, its face inches away now, its voice dropping to a whisper.  

“Wake up.”  

---

Suddenly, everything shattered.  

The walls, the floor, the ceiling—splintered into fragments, breaking apart like glass. Avery fell through the void, screaming as the pieces of reality spun around them. They were weightless, formless, plummeting deeper and deeper into nothingness.  

*“Wake up!”*  

The voice surrounded them now—Elise’s voice, the reflection’s voice, their own voice—melding together into a cacophony. Avery’s mind felt like it was splitting apart, every thought unraveling.  

And then—  

Light.  

Blinding, overwhelming light.  

Avery’s body hit solid ground with a brutal thud. Pain flared in their limbs as they groaned, forcing their eyes open.  

They were lying in the center of the lab.  

The real lab.  

Everything was still. Silent. The air smelled of chemicals and burnt wiring. Monitors blinked faintly, and the memory device sat on the table, dormant and lifeless.  

Avery sat up slowly, their entire body trembling.  

It felt real. It *looked* real. But could they trust it? Could they trust *anything*?  

From behind them, a voice broke the silence.  

“Avery?”  

Avery turned sharply.  

Elise was standing at the doorway, her face pale and wide-eyed. She looked *real*. Her voice trembled with worry.  

“Oh my god… Avery, you’re awake.”  

Avery stared at her, their heart pounding. “What… what’s happening?”  

Elise rushed forward, dropping to her knees beside them. “You’ve been out for hours. The machine… it overloaded. You—” She paused, taking a shaky breath. “We thought we’d lost you.”  

Avery’s head spun as they tried to process her words. “Hours?”  

Elise nodded, her expression earnest and afraid. “You weren’t responding. You… you kept muttering things—like you were trapped.”  

Avery stared at her, their mind screaming at them to *trust nothing*.  

“Is this real?” they whispered.  

Elise frowned. “Avery, what are you talking about? Of course this is real. It’s me. It’s—”  

“No!” Avery shot to their feet, backing away. “I don’t believe you. This is another loop. Another trick!”  

Elise’s face fell. “Avery… you need to calm down.”  

“Don’t tell me to calm down!” Avery shouted, their voice raw. “You’re lying. You’re not real. None of this is!”  

Elise rose to her feet slowly, her eyes filled with concern. “Avery… please.”  

Avery’s gaze darted around the lab. Everything looked *perfect*. Too perfect.  

*Too real.*  

Their mind splintered with doubt.  

Was this the truth? Or was it another illusion?  

---

## **Chapter 8: The Threshold (Part 2)**  

Avery’s pulse pounded in their ears as the walls of the lab seemed to close in. Elise stood motionless, her expression frozen somewhere between concern and confusion, but Avery couldn’t shake the feeling that *something* was off. The edges of the room felt… sharp, too precise, like a painting where the brushstrokes hadn’t blended quite right.  

“Stop looking at me like that,” Avery muttered, their voice unsteady.  

Elise took a tentative step forward. “Avery, listen to me. You’ve been through a lot. You’re disoriented.” Her tone was calm, measured—too measured. “The machine overloaded. You’re just—confused.”  

The word sent a jolt through Avery’s mind. *Confused.* The same word Elise—or some version of her—had used in the swing set memory.  

“No,” Avery whispered, backing away, their hands trembling. “You’re not real. *This* isn’t real. I can feel it.”  

“Avery, please,” Elise pleaded, her voice wavering. “You need to trust me.”  

Avery’s eyes darted toward the memory device sitting dormant on the table. It looked harmless—innocent, even—but Avery *knew* better. That machine had been at the center of everything, every loop, every fracture in their mind.  

“Why is it still here?” Avery demanded, pointing a shaking finger at the device.  

Elise hesitated. “What do you mean?”  

“It’s off,” Avery said, their voice growing louder. “If it overloaded, why is it just sitting there? Why isn’t it damaged?”  

“I—” Elise’s mouth opened, but no words came out.  

Avery’s heart slammed against their ribs as the air in the room seemed to *thicken*. Elise’s presence suddenly felt wrong—like a puppet whose strings were beginning to fray.  

“Tell me where I am,” Avery growled, their voice low and desperate.  

Elise blinked once. Twice. Her eyes seemed to lose focus for a fraction of a second, like a glitch in a recording.  

“You’re safe, Avery,” she said, but her voice was *off* now—too smooth, too rehearsed.  

Avery staggered back, panic clawing at their throat. “No. No, you’re lying!”  

They grabbed the nearest thing they could find—a steel tray—and flung it across the room. It hit the ground with a deafening *clang*, the sound reverberating like thunder. Elise didn’t flinch. She didn’t even blink.  

“Wake up, Avery,” she said.  

Avery froze, their blood turning to ice.  

“What did you say?”  

Elise’s head tilted unnaturally to the side, her expression eerily serene. “Wake up, Avery. You can’t stay here.”  

The room began to shift—*warp*. The edges of the walls rippled, as if the entire lab were made of liquid glass. The lights flickered, the hum of the machines distorting into a low, droning growl.  

Avery clutched their head, their knees buckling under the weight of it. “Stop!”  

“You have to let go,” Elise’s voice echoed, layered and distorted now. “You can’t hold on to this anymore.”  

A sharp, splitting *crack* erupted through the air, and Avery screamed as the lab shattered like a mirror around them. The pieces of the room broke apart, floating and spinning into the void, leaving Avery suspended in a blinding white light.  

---

When the light faded, Avery found themselves standing on solid ground again.  

But this time, they weren’t alone.  

The reflection—their double—stood a few feet away, watching them silently. The two of them were in an endless, empty space, the ground beneath them smooth and featureless.  

“You keep running,” the reflection said quietly. “But there’s nowhere left to go.”  

Avery’s chest heaved as they turned to face their double. “Why are you doing this?”  

The reflection shook its head, a faint smile tugging at the corner of its mouth. “You still don’t get it, do you?”  

“Get what?” Avery spat, their voice cracking.  

The reflection stepped closer, its hollow eyes locking onto Avery’s. “This isn’t about *me*. It’s about you.”  

Avery took a step back, their body trembling. “You’re not making any sense.”  

The reflection’s voice softened. “Think, Avery. Think about the *machine*. Think about why you built it. Why you wanted it to work so badly.”  

The machine. The device that had promised so much—relief, freedom, a way to erase pain.  

Avery squeezed their eyes shut as flashes of memory cut through their mind: Elise’s warnings, the swing set, the child’s laughter, the scream.  

The scream.  

A sob caught in Avery’s throat as realization clawed its way to the surface. “No.”  

“Yes,” the reflection whispered. “You erased it. You *erased* them.”  

Avery’s breath hitched, tears spilling down their cheeks. “I didn’t mean to.”  

“But you did,” the reflection said gently. “You built the machine to forget. To bury the truth. To hide from your guilt. But the mind doesn’t forget, Avery. It just fractures.”  

Avery sank to their knees, their body shaking with the weight of the words. “I didn’t want to remember. I couldn’t—”  

“I know,” the reflection said softly. “But running doesn’t make it go away. It only makes the pain worse.”  

Avery looked up at their double, tears blurring their vision. “Then what do I do?”  

The reflection knelt beside them, its voice barely above a whisper. “You wake up.”  

Avery swallowed hard, their entire body trembling. “What if I don’t want to?”  

The reflection’s expression softened, a faint trace of compassion flickering in its dark eyes. “Then you’ll stay here. Trapped. Forever.”  

Avery stared at the reflection, the weight of the choice settling in their chest like a stone.  

Wake up. Face the truth.  

Or stay here, lost in the loops of their own creation.  

Their voice broke as they whispered, “How do I wake up?”  

The reflection held out its hand. “You already know.”  

Avery hesitated, their heart pounding. Slowly, they reached out, their fingers brushing against the reflection’s outstretched hand—  

And everything went dark.  

---



## **Chapter 9: The Descent (Part 1)**  

Darkness.  

It was absolute—thick, suffocating, pressing against Avery’s skin like a living thing. They drifted in it, weightless, untethered, their mind suspended between numbness and chaos.  

*Wake up.*  

The words echoed in the void, distant and distorted.  

*Wake up.*  

Avery tried to move, but there was no body, no ground, nothing to grasp. Only the voice—familiar, yet foreign. It wasn’t Elise’s voice. It wasn’t their reflection.  

It was *theirs*.  

*“You erased it.”*  

The memory cut through the darkness like a blade.  

A scream. Blood on their hands. A child’s laughter fading into silence.  

“No,” Avery whispered, their voice trembling. “Stop it.”  

But the memories kept coming. Shards of light breaking through the dark—violent flashes of color, sound, pain.  

The lab. The device humming to life. Elise shouting their name, her voice panicked.  

And then—  

*Nothing.*  

---

When the darkness lifted, Avery found themselves standing in a *house*.  

It was warm, lived-in—sunlight spilled through the curtains, casting soft golden rays across the wooden floor. The air smelled faintly of coffee and flowers, and somewhere in the distance, a soft breeze rattled a wind chime.  

Avery blinked, disoriented. Their body felt solid again, their feet grounded. This place was… calm. *Safe.*  

But Avery knew better.  

They turned slowly, their eyes sweeping the room. It was a living room—simple, unremarkable. A couch, a coffee table with a half-empty mug, and shelves lined with photographs.  

Avery hesitated, their pulse quickening. The photographs.  

One by one, they stepped closer, dread coiling in their stomach.  

The frames were turned inward.  

Avery reached for the nearest one, their fingers trembling. Slowly, they turned it around.  

The glass was cracked. Beneath it, a photo of *themself*. Smiling. Beside them stood a woman with dark hair and bright eyes—eyes that sparkled with warmth and love.  

Avery’s breath hitched.  

*Elise.*  

No. Not Elise. Not the Elise they knew. The woman in the photo looked softer, younger—her presence full of life. And in her arms…  

Avery’s chest tightened as their gaze fell to the child she held.  

A girl. No more than four or five. Her face was blurred, indistinct, as though the memory itself refused to let Avery see.  

The picture slipped from Avery’s hands, shattering against the floor.  

“*Who was she?*” Avery whispered, their voice breaking.  

“You know.”  

The voice made Avery spin around.  

The reflection was there again, standing in the doorway. Its posture was relaxed, its expression unreadable, but its presence seemed *heavier* now—like the air bent around it.  

Avery shook their head. “No. No, I don’t.”  

The reflection stepped forward. “Yes, you do.”  

Avery backed away until they hit the wall. “Why are you doing this? Why are you showing me this?”  

The reflection tilted its head. “I’m not showing you anything. *You’re remembering.*”  

Avery froze, their heart pounding. “No. I don’t want to. I can’t—”  

“You *have* to.”  

The words rang with finality, and as the reflection spoke, the room around them began to *shift*.  

The light dimmed. The warm colors faded to gray. The air grew heavy, and the sound of the wind chime turned into a hollow, metallic clang.  

The child’s laughter echoed faintly in the distance.  

Avery sank to their knees, clutching their head. “Stop it. Please stop.”  

The reflection stood over them now, its dark, empty eyes fixed on Avery.  

“You built the machine to escape this,” it said softly. “To erase *her*. To erase *them*. But memory doesn’t die, Avery. It festers. It *waits*.”  

A sharp pain split through Avery’s skull, and they cried out, collapsing onto the cold, shifting floor.  

Images flooded their mind again—the child’s blurred face, the swing set, *the accident*.  

Blood.  

The sound of sirens. Elise’s voice screaming their name.  

And then—  

The machine.  

*Erase it. Make it go away.*  

Avery gasped, their body wracked with sobs. “I didn’t mean to. I didn’t mean to forget.”  

The reflection knelt beside them, its voice soft now. “But you did.”  

Avery lifted their tear-streaked face, staring at their double through blurry eyes. “Why are you doing this?”  

The reflection reached out, placing a cold hand on Avery’s shoulder.  

“Because it’s time to stop running.”  

The ground beneath Avery began to splinter. Cracks spiderwebbed across the surface, and the house—everything around them—started to crumble.  

“No!” Avery screamed, grabbing at the floor as it broke apart, pulling them into the void. “No, please—*I’m not ready!*”  

The reflection’s voice echoed as the darkness swallowed them whole.  

“You have to be.”  

---

When Avery’s eyes opened, they were back in the lab.  

But something was different.  

The air was still, but it carried a weight that hadn’t been there before. The monitors around the room were dark, and the memory device sat on the table, its surface cracked, faint wisps of smoke curling from its circuits.  

Avery pushed themselves upright, their body trembling. The floor beneath them felt solid. Real.  

And across the room, sitting in one of the chairs, was Elise.  

Her head was bowed, her dark hair falling forward, but her voice was clear and steady.  

“You finally did it.”  

Avery blinked, disoriented. “Did… what?”  

Elise lifted her head, her eyes meeting Avery’s. They were filled with exhaustion—and something else. *Relief.*  

“You remembered.”  

Avery’s breath caught in their throat. “I… I don’t understand.”  

Elise stood slowly, crossing the room until she stood in front of Avery. “You’ve been looping for so long, Avery. Trapped. Fighting yourself. All because you refused to face what happened.”  

Avery swallowed hard, their voice shaking. “The child. Who was she?”  

Elise placed a gentle hand on Avery’s shoulder. “You already know.”  

The room felt like it was spinning. Avery squeezed their eyes shut as tears spilled down their cheeks. The laughter. The swing set. The accident.  

“My daughter,” Avery choked out, the words barely audible.  

Elise nodded, her voice breaking. “Yes.”  

Avery collapsed back to the ground, the weight of the truth crushing them. “I tried to erase her. I tried to forget her.”  

“You thought it would stop the pain,” Elise said softly, kneeling beside them. “But it doesn’t work like that.”  

Avery looked up, their face pale and tear-streaked. “What do I do now?”  

Elise’s expression was gentle, almost maternal. “You face it. You let it hurt. And then… you *let it go.*”  

Avery’s heart pounded as they took a shaky breath, the memory of their daughter’s laughter ringing faintly in their ears. For the first time, they didn’t try to push it away.  

---

## **Chapter 9: The Descent (Part 2)**  

The weight of Elise’s words hung heavy in the air.  

*“You face it. You let it hurt. And then… you let it go.”*  

Avery’s chest rose and fell with ragged breaths, their pulse thundering in their ears. The memory of the little girl—their daughter—felt like an open wound, throbbing with a pain they’d spent so long trying to erase.  

“I don’t know how to,” Avery whispered, their voice shaking.  

“You start by accepting it,” Elise replied softly. “The pain. The truth.”  

Avery squeezed their eyes shut, trembling as flashes of the memory returned. The swing set. The sunlight filtering through the trees. The laughter—so bright and full of life. And then the scream. The sickening sound of impact.  

A sob tore through Avery’s throat. They could see it now. *All of it.*  

“I should have saved her,” Avery choked out, their hands clawing at the floor. “I should have been watching—”  

Elise’s hand tightened gently on their shoulder. “You can’t change the past, Avery. You know that.”  

“But I built the machine to try,” Avery shot back, their voice filled with raw desperation. “I thought—if I could erase it—if I could forget—”  

“You thought it would make the guilt disappear,” Elise interrupted, her voice steady but kind. “But it only fractured you. You built the machine to help others forget their pain. But deep down, you were just trying to escape your own.”  

Avery looked up at her, their tear-streaked face pale and hollow. “Then what was the point? What was *any* of this for?”  

Elise knelt down so they were eye level, her gaze unwavering. “It wasn’t to forget, Avery. It was to remember. To accept the truth and find a way to live with it.”  

Avery’s shoulders sagged, the weight of it all crushing them. “I don’t know if I can.”  

Elise’s expression softened. “You can. But you have to want to.”  

The words settled into Avery’s mind like a seed—small, but persistent. They looked down at their trembling hands, the lines on their palms stark against the pale skin. The hands of someone who had tried to *fix* everything… and broken themselves in the process.  

“What happens if I can’t let go?” Avery asked quietly.  

Elise stood, her face shadowed by the dim light of the broken lab. “Then you stay here. Trapped in the loops you created. Reliving the fracture over and over again.”  

The thought sent a chill through Avery’s body. They looked around the lab, at the cracked memory device, at the scorched walls and shattered monitors. The room felt alive in its brokenness—like it was *watching* them, waiting for their decision.  

Avery forced themselves to their feet, their legs unsteady beneath them. “What do I have to do?”  

Elise nodded toward the memory device. “Destroy it.”  

Avery froze, their heart skipping a beat. “What?”  

Elise stepped back, her expression resolute. “You have to let it go. The machine, the memories you tried to erase—all of it. It’s the only way out.”  

Avery turned to face the device. Its surface still glowed faintly, faint tendrils of smoke curling up like ghosts. It looked fragile now—smaller, almost pitiful—but Avery could still feel the power it held over them.  

The power to erase. To forget.  

Avery clenched their fists, torn between fear and anger. *Destroy it.* Could they really do it? Could they really let go?  

“This is your choice, Avery,” Elise said softly from behind them. “No one can make it for you.”  

Avery took a slow step forward, the sound of their shoes scraping against the floor echoing in the silent lab. The closer they got to the device, the more the memories pushed at the edges of their mind—raw and sharp, demanding to be felt.  

The laughter.  
The swing.  
The scream.  

Their daughter’s face—no longer blurred.  

Avery let out a shuddering breath, tears blinding them as they reached out and touched the machine. The surface was cold, lifeless… but it felt like holding their guilt in their hands.  

“You have to let it go,” Elise’s voice repeated, steady and distant.  

Avery’s fingers curled around the edge of the device. For a long moment, they hesitated, their mind screaming at them to stop.  

*What if I can’t live with the truth?*  

But then, a quiet voice inside whispered back:  

*What if you can?*  

Avery gritted their teeth, summoning every ounce of strength left in their broken body. With a cry that echoed through the shattered lab, they wrenched the device off the table and hurled it to the ground.  

The machine exploded in a shower of sparks and glass, the sound like a thousand mirrors breaking at once. Avery staggered back, shielding their face as the room around them began to *shift*. The walls rippled and cracked, the floor splintering like ice beneath their feet.  

“No!” Avery gasped, stumbling. “What’s happening?”  

Elise’s voice rang out, calm and clear amidst the chaos. “You’re waking up.”  

The cracks spread, light pouring through them—blinding, searing white light that filled every corner of the lab. Avery collapsed to their knees, tears streaming down their face as the memories surged through them one final time.  

The laughter. The swing. The scream.  

And then—  

A stillness.  

The pain remained, but it no longer felt like it would consume them. It was *there*—a part of them—but it was real. Honest.  

As the light grew brighter, Avery closed their eyes and whispered, “I’m sorry.”  

A soft breeze brushed against their face, carrying with it a voice—light and full of love.  

“It’s okay, Daddy.”  

Avery’s breath hitched, a sob escaping as the light swallowed them whole.  

---

When they opened their eyes again, Avery was lying on the floor of the lab.  

The room was quiet now. Still. The memory device was gone—nothing left but ash and faint scorch marks on the ground. The monitors were dark, the hum of the machines silenced.  

Avery pushed themselves up, their body aching, but *alive*.  

The reflection was gone. Elise was gone.  

It was just Avery now, alone with the truth.  

They looked down at their hands—solid, real—and took a deep, shaky breath. The pain was still there, but it felt… lighter, somehow. Bearable.  

And for the first time in a long time, the lab didn’t feel like a prison.  

Avery stood, their movements slow but steady. They turned to the door—an ordinary door that now seemed full of possibility.  

With one final glance at the empty lab, they stepped through it, into the light beyond.  

---




## **Chapter 10: Fragments Rebuilt (Part 1)**  

The light beyond the door was blinding at first, a stark contrast to the suffocating darkness Avery had lived in for so long. For a moment, they stood frozen, unsure if their feet were still on solid ground or if they had stepped into another illusion.  

But then, the light began to soften. Shadows formed, shapes sharpening into clarity, and as the brightness dimmed, Avery saw where they were.  

They were standing in the middle of a park.  

The grass was lush and green, speckled with small white flowers swaying in the breeze. Trees lined the edges of a pathway that stretched ahead, their leaves a deep, vibrant emerald. A faint scent of lilac lingered in the air, carried by the breeze. The world was calm, peaceful—*real.*  

Avery blinked, adjusting to the new reality. Their heart raced as they looked down at their hands, turning them over carefully. No tremors. No glitches in their vision. Just steady, solid flesh and bone.  

“This can’t be real,” Avery muttered, their voice hoarse. “It’s too… clear.”  

And yet, every sensation told them otherwise. The breeze was cool against their skin. The sunlight warm on their face. Even the distant laughter of children playing somewhere nearby felt *tangible* in a way the illusions never had.  

Avery turned slowly, scanning the horizon for any sign of familiarity. The park stretched out in all directions—serene and empty, save for a single bench near the path. A woman sat there, her back to Avery, her dark hair cascading over her shoulders.  

Avery’s breath caught.  

“Elise?”  

They hesitated for a moment, then forced their legs to move, each step slow and deliberate. The closer they got, the stronger the gnawing in their chest became—grief, hope, fear, all swirling together.  

The woman remained still, staring out at the open field ahead. Avery finally reached her and came to a stop a few feet away, their voice barely above a whisper.  

“Elise?”  

The woman turned.  

It wasn’t Elise.  

Avery flinched, an instinctive sting of disappointment hitting them. The woman had the same dark hair, the same calm presence, but her face was unfamiliar. Her eyes, however, were something else entirely.  

They weren’t just looking *at* Avery. They were *studying* them.  

“You’ve come far,” the woman said softly, her voice smooth and even. “I wasn’t sure you would.”  

Avery frowned. “Who… are you?”  

The woman tilted her head slightly, as though considering the question. “I’m a guide. A fragment, like all the others you’ve seen. Only this time, I’m here to help you finish.”  

“Finish?” Avery asked, their tone wary. “Finish what?”  

The woman gestured to the path ahead, the cracks of gravel catching the sunlight. “You’ve started to face your truth. You’ve begun to let go. But there’s still one final choice you have to make.”  

Avery’s pulse quickened. “What choice?”  

The woman stood, her movements fluid and deliberate. “You’ve been clinging to the past—running from it, hiding from it, burying it under illusions. Now that you’ve remembered, the question is… what will you do with the truth?”  

Avery stiffened. The words struck deep, as though this woman had reached into their chest and pulled the thought straight from their core. “I don’t understand.”  

The woman smiled faintly, though there was no malice in it—only sadness. “You’ve been given a second chance, Avery. A chance to rebuild. To live again. But you have to decide what that life looks like.”  

Avery’s mind swirled. A second chance? The idea felt impossible. How could they live with this truth, this pain, and somehow move forward? It felt like a weight too heavy to bear.  

“What if I can’t?” Avery asked quietly, their voice almost childlike. “What if I don’t deserve that chance?”  

The woman’s gaze softened. “Deserving has nothing to do with it. Pain is a part of you now. But it doesn’t have to define you.”  

Avery’s throat tightened. “And if I don’t choose?”  

The woman looked past them, toward the edge of the park where the trees seemed to stretch into darkness, their forms twisting and unnatural. “Then the loops will find you again. They always do.”  

A chill ran through Avery’s body as they turned to follow her gaze. The shadows beyond the trees were already creeping closer, tendrils of darkness curling toward the path like smoke.  

*The loops.*  

Avery remembered the void, the endless cycles of fragmented realities. The crushing feeling of being trapped with no escape.  

“No,” they whispered, shaking their head. “I can’t go back to that. I won’t.”  

“Then walk forward,” the woman said, her voice gentle but firm. “Let the truth guide you. Even if it hurts.”  

Avery looked at the path ahead. It stretched far into the distance, disappearing into a golden haze. They had no idea what lay at the end—whether it was salvation, redemption, or something worse.  

But the choice was theirs to make.  

For the first time in a long time, Avery felt the stirrings of something they thought they’d lost: hope.  

They looked back at the woman, who nodded once, as though reading their decision. “Go on. You’re ready.”  

Avery swallowed hard and turned toward the path. Their steps were hesitant at first, but as they moved, the ground beneath their feet felt steadier. Realer.  

The sun climbed higher in the sky, and with every step, the shadowy tendrils fell further behind, shrinking back into the trees.  

*Let the truth guide you,* the woman had said.  

Avery kept walking, one step at a time, the echoes of laughter and pain trailing behind them like ghosts. They weren’t gone, but they were quieter now.  

For once, Avery didn’t turn back.  

---

## **Chapter 10: Fragments Rebuilt (Part 2)**  

Avery walked for what felt like hours. The path beneath their feet seemed endless, stretching into the golden haze like a ribbon that tied them to some unseen destination. At first, every step felt weighted—hesitant and unsure—as if they were afraid the ground would dissolve into another illusion.  

But it didn’t.  

The sunlight remained warm. The sky above stayed clear, a soft expanse of pale blue that seemed to breathe with life. Every step forward felt more *real* than the last, grounding Avery in a way they hadn’t felt for years.  

The tendrils of shadow that had once crept at their heels had long vanished. Avery didn’t dare turn back to look, but deep inside, they knew: the loops wouldn’t reach them here. Not as long as they kept moving forward.  

For the first time, there was no one else. No ghost of Elise. No strange fragments pulling at their mind. Just Avery and the silence.  

It was unsettling at first, the absence of noise almost deafening. For so long, they had been surrounded by echoes—memories, machines, voices whispering things they didn’t want to hear. Now, in the stillness, Avery was left with only themselves.  

And the truth.  

The truth hurt, but it didn’t destroy them.  

It was there as they walked—a quiet companion. It reminded them of their failures, of the moments that had broken them. Of the little girl whose laughter they’d held onto and whose absence had shattered their world.  

*You can’t change the past.*  

The words rang in Avery’s mind like a steady drumbeat, but now, they weren’t as sharp. They were *true.* And like all truths, they carried weight, but they also carried something else—freedom.  

The path began to change.  

The gravel gave way to smooth, white stone that shone in the sunlight. The golden haze ahead began to lift, revealing the edges of a structure. As Avery moved closer, their breath caught.  

A bridge.  

It was long and narrow, made of the same white stone as the path, and it stretched out over a vast, shimmering expanse of water. The surface of the water rippled with light, reflecting the sky above in colors Avery couldn’t name—soft blues, silvers, and faint hints of gold.  

The bridge seemed impossibly delicate, almost fragile, yet it didn’t waver. It waited for Avery like a promise, an unspoken challenge.  

Avery hesitated at the edge. The space ahead felt different from the path they had been walking—this wasn’t just about moving forward anymore. The bridge felt final.  

*What if I fall?*  

The thought came unbidden, sharp and sudden. The water below looked calm, but Avery couldn’t shake the feeling that it held more than reflections. It felt *alive*—waiting, watching.  

A gust of wind swept across the bridge, tugging at Avery’s clothes like an invitation.  

“This is it,” they whispered to themselves, their voice almost lost in the breeze.  

Their fingers curled into fists, steadying their breath. This was the moment of choice.  

Avery thought back to the machine, to the shattered lab, to all the years they had spent trying to erase the unbearable. And now, here they were—standing at the edge of something new, something unknown.  

Letting go wasn’t easy. It felt like stepping off the edge of everything they’d ever known.  

But clinging to the past—to the guilt and the pain—hadn’t brought Avery peace.  

It had only fractured them.  

*“You face it. You let it hurt. And then… you let it go.”*  

Elise’s voice echoed softly in their mind, carrying them forward.  

Avery placed one foot on the bridge.  

The stone was solid beneath their weight.  

They took another step.  

And another.  

The bridge didn’t break. The water below remained calm, rippling gently as though cheering them on.  

With every step, the weight on Avery’s chest grew lighter. The memories didn’t disappear—Avery could still feel them, still see their daughter’s face when they closed their eyes. But they weren’t being crushed by it anymore.  

The pain was there, but so was something else: a quiet, tentative strength.  

Avery reached the center of the bridge and paused, looking out over the vast water stretching endlessly in every direction. For the first time in a long time, they felt small—but not insignificant. The world felt wide and open, and there was a place for them in it.  

Somewhere in the water’s shimmering depths, Avery thought they heard laughter—soft and distant, like a memory carried on the wind.  

It didn’t hurt.  

It made them smile.  

Avery closed their eyes and let the breeze wash over them.  

“Goodbye,” they whispered, not to anyone in particular, but to the part of themselves that had been trapped for so long. The part that had been afraid to face the truth.  

They opened their eyes and began walking again.  

The bridge stretched ahead, endless and full of possibility.  

And Avery walked on, leaving the fractures behind.

## **Act 3: Reconstruction**  

## **Chapter 11: A New Horizon (Part 1)**  

Avery’s footsteps echoed faintly against the white stone bridge as they walked. The bridge stretched endlessly ahead, but for the first time, Avery wasn’t afraid of the unknown. Each step felt purposeful, steady—like they were finally moving toward something instead of running away.

The water below shimmered with an iridescent light, rippling softly as though it breathed with the rhythm of Avery’s steps. The reflection of the sky above seemed to stretch deep into its surface, a mirror to everything Avery had yet to understand.  

As they walked, the golden haze ahead began to thin, revealing the faint outline of what looked like land in the distance. The horizon glowed with a muted light—soft, as if the day was about to break but hadn’t quite touched the earth.  

Avery slowed, frowning as they squinted toward the far end of the bridge. A figure stood there, waiting.  

Even from this distance, Avery could feel the presence—the weight of being watched. It wasn’t threatening. It was… expectant.  

With a deep breath, Avery continued. The closer they got, the more details emerged from the haze. The figure was a man, his posture relaxed yet purposeful, arms folded loosely across his chest. He stood at the threshold where the bridge met solid ground.  

Avery froze when they recognized him.  

It was *themselves*.  

The other Avery—the one waiting on the other side of the bridge—looked eerily identical: same sharp features, same tousled hair streaked with strands of silver, same wary gaze. Yet there was something different, something *calmer* about the version of themselves that stood before them now.  

The other Avery smiled faintly as the real Avery stopped just a few feet away. “You made it,” they said. Their voice was steady, clear, and strong—a version of Avery that hadn’t been broken.  

Avery’s heart thudded in their chest. “Who are you?”  

The reflection tilted their head slightly, the smile softening. “You already know.”  

Avery’s fists clenched at their sides, though they didn’t feel anger—only confusion. “You’re another illusion,” they whispered. “Another trick.”  

The reflection shook their head. “No. I’m you.”  

“That’s impossible.”  

“And yet, here we are.”  

The words hung in the air like a challenge. Avery’s mind churned, the weight of the encounter pressing against their thoughts. For so long, they had been fractured—splintered pieces of themselves scattered across illusions and nightmares. Seeing themselves whole and steady felt like standing in the presence of something *impossible*.  

The reflection stepped closer, holding Avery’s gaze. “You’ve come farther than you realize,” they said gently. “The machine didn’t trap you. *You* did.”  

Avery flinched, their breath catching. “I—”  

“You thought the loops were your prison,” the reflection continued. “The fragments. The false realities. You believed you were trapped by the machine, by them, by *something else*. But the truth is, Avery, you were holding yourself here.”  

Avery shook their head, backing away slightly. “I didn’t choose this!”  

“You didn’t want to *face* it,” the reflection corrected softly. “The pain. The guilt. The truth. You kept yourself locked inside the machine because part of you thought you deserved to stay here. To suffer.”  

Avery’s chest tightened, their vision blurring with unshed tears. The reflection’s words struck too close, tearing through the last of the defenses Avery had built over years of denial.  

“I didn’t mean to—” Avery’s voice broke, and they couldn’t finish the sentence.  

“I know,” the reflection said, their tone full of understanding. “But the past doesn’t change. What matters is what you do now. Are you ready to let go?”  

Avery swallowed hard. Their hands trembled as they looked into the reflection’s steady gaze. They felt like they were staring into their own soul—into the person they used to be before everything shattered.  

“I don’t know how,” Avery whispered.  

“You’re already doing it,” the reflection replied. “You’re still here. You’re still walking forward. That’s all it takes.”  

Avery blinked, a tear slipping down their cheek. The weight of the conversation settled deep in their chest, heavy and painful, but there was also something else—a fragile lightness beneath it, as though the pressure was beginning to lift.  

The reflection extended a hand. “This is the moment, Avery. You have a choice. Keep running, or step into what’s next.”  

Avery looked at the outstretched hand, hesitating. The bridge beneath their feet seemed to hum with energy, the faint sound of rippling water echoing softly around them.  

They knew the reflection was right. The machine—the loops—had only been the tool. Avery’s refusal to face the truth had been the real prison.  

Avery took a deep breath, feeling their heartbeat slow and steady.  

Then, they reached out and clasped the reflection’s hand.  

The moment their fingers touched, the world shifted.  

The golden haze melted into brilliant light, blinding Avery with its intensity. A wave of energy surged through them—sharp and electric, yet strangely gentle—as though something deep within them was being rewired.  

Avery closed their eyes against the light, their grip on the reflection’s hand tightening.  

When they opened their eyes again, the reflection was gone.  

And so was the bridge.  

Avery stood on solid ground—grass beneath their feet, the air crisp and cool around them. They turned in a slow circle, trying to take in their surroundings. It wasn’t the lab. It wasn’t the void.  

It was a wide, open field. The sun hung low in the sky, bathing everything in a warm golden glow. Birds chirped faintly in the distance, and a soft wind rustled through the tall grass.  

Avery’s heart raced as they realized what this meant.  

They were *out.*  

Not in another loop, not in another illusion. This was real.  

A laugh—disbelieving and breathless—escaped Avery’s lips. They dropped to their knees, pressing their hands against the earth just to feel its solidity beneath their palms.  

They were free.  

But freedom didn’t mean the end.  

It was only the beginning.  

---

## **Chapter 11: A New Horizon (Part 2)**  

Avery stayed on their knees for several long moments, their hands pressed into the grass as if afraid the world beneath them would vanish. The blades tickled their palms—real, vibrant, alive.  

No shifting corridors. No pulsing machines. No cracks in the sky.  

Real.  

The word echoed in Avery’s mind like a revelation. For so long, they had been chasing this—freedom, solidity—but now that it was here, it felt almost too big to comprehend.  

Slowly, they pushed themselves upright and scanned the horizon. The field stretched endlessly in all directions, the grass swaying in waves beneath a soft, golden light. In the distance, a line of trees marked the edge of the field—tall, dark silhouettes against the glowing sky.  

It was peaceful here. Quiet.  

The wind carried the faintest scent of flowers, something Avery hadn’t noticed at first. They inhaled deeply, filling their lungs with the cool, clean air. It felt foreign to breathe so freely, without the hum of machines or the weight of stale, recycled air pressing down on them.  

It felt like stepping into a dream.  

*“Where do I go now?”*  

The thought came unbidden, sharp against the calm. Avery frowned as they glanced around, searching for some kind of landmark—something to guide them. But the field remained open and unbroken, save for the distant trees.  

Instinct told them to move toward the trees.  

With one last glance at the sky, Avery began walking.  

The grass brushed against their legs as they moved, the steady rhythm of their footsteps grounding them. Each step brought new sensations—the soft give of the earth beneath their boots, the whisper of the wind in their ears, the faint ache in their muscles.  

They felt alive.  

*Too alive.*  

The thought struck Avery like a chill, and they faltered mid-step. The wind blew harder suddenly, cold and sharp, as if sensing the shift in their thoughts.  

Avery turned in place, scanning the field again.  

The golden glow felt dimmer now, the edges of the horizon darker than before.  

*What if this isn’t real?*  

The question lodged itself in Avery’s mind like a splinter.  

“No,” they whispered, shaking their head as if to dispel it. “This is real. It has to be.”  

The wind howled louder, whipping at Avery’s clothes. The golden light flickered, just for a second, as though the world itself had hesitated.  

Avery froze. Their breath came in short, shallow bursts as a creeping dread settled in their chest.  

*Don’t doubt it.*  

The voice wasn’t theirs. It came from everywhere and nowhere at once—low and smooth, like a warning whispered in the dark.  

“Who’s there?” Avery called out, spinning in place.  

No answer.  

The field stretched on, unchanged, but Avery’s instincts screamed that something was wrong.  

They turned toward the distant tree line again, squinting. For a moment, they thought they saw something move—just a shadow slipping between the trunks—but when they blinked, it was gone.  

*Keep moving.*  

Avery’s pulse quickened, but they obeyed. The sense of peace that had wrapped around them moments ago had vanished, replaced by an edge of unease that set every nerve on edge.  

The trees loomed closer now, their dark forms more distinct against the dimming light. Avery couldn’t shake the feeling that they were being watched. The silence was no longer comforting—it pressed against them, heavy and suffocating.  

*You’re not free yet.*  

The voice again, low and accusing, sent a shiver down Avery’s spine. They stumbled forward, their pace quickening as they neared the trees. The grass seemed to cling to their boots, pulling at them like invisible hands trying to drag them back.  

“No,” Avery whispered, forcing their legs to keep moving. “I’m not going back.”  

The moment they reached the edge of the tree line, the wind stopped.  

Everything went silent.  

Avery hesitated, staring into the dark forest before them. The trees were massive—gnarled trunks and thick branches that intertwined overhead, casting the path beyond into shadow. It was like staring into the mouth of something ancient and hungry.  

Avery swallowed hard. They glanced back over their shoulder.  

The field behind them was gone.  

Instead, there was only darkness—a vast, empty void that seemed to stretch infinitely where the golden light had been. Avery’s heart dropped.  

*There’s no going back.*  

The voice was inside their head now, its tone colder than before.  

Avery turned back to the forest, their hands trembling at their sides. They didn’t want to enter. Every instinct screamed at them to run, but there was nowhere to go—only forward.  

*Face it.*  

The words were Elise’s this time, soft and steady in Avery’s memory.  

Avery closed their eyes and breathed deeply. The ache in their chest threatened to overwhelm them, but they held onto the words like a lifeline.  

*Face it.*  

Opening their eyes, Avery stepped into the forest.  

The air inside was colder, thicker. The shadows pressed close, but Avery didn’t stop moving. Branches clawed at their clothes as they pushed deeper, the path ahead winding and uneven.  

Somewhere in the distance, a sound echoed—soft at first, like footsteps following in their wake.  

Avery stopped abruptly, straining to listen.  

Silence.  

*Keep moving.*  

They forced themselves forward, but the sound returned—closer this time. Footsteps. Heavy. Deliberate.  

Avery’s pulse thundered in their ears as they turned slowly, scanning the darkness behind them.  

At first, there was nothing. Just shadows.  

But then… movement.  

A shape emerged from the darkness—a silhouette, tall and broad, stepping toward Avery with slow, deliberate movements. Its face was obscured, its edges blurred as though it didn’t belong here.  

Avery stumbled back. “Who are you?”  

The figure didn’t answer. It stopped a few feet away, its presence heavy and overwhelming. Avery couldn’t see its face, but they could feel its gaze—a weight that pinned them in place.  

*You know who I am.*  

The voice was deep and familiar, like an echo of Avery’s own.  

“No,” Avery whispered, shaking their head violently. “You’re not real.”  

The figure stepped closer, its form distorting—shifting between shadows and something Avery couldn’t name.  

*You can’t run from me forever.*  

Avery staggered back, their breathing ragged as panic clawed at their mind. The figure reached out a hand, its fingers stretching toward Avery’s chest as if to tear something from them.  

“Stop!” Avery screamed.  

And then—  

The forest split open with a blinding flash of light.  

The figure vanished, ripped apart by the brilliance, and Avery collapsed to the ground, gasping for air. The shadows retreated, and for a moment, there was only silence.  

Then, a voice.  

Soft. Familiar.  

*“Keep going, Avery. You’re almost there.”*  

Avery looked up, tears streaming down their face.  

The forest was gone.  

They were kneeling on the edge of something new—something brighter.  

The path stretched forward again, waiting.  

---




## **Chapter 12: Through the Shadows (Part 1)**  

Avery’s breaths came in shallow gasps as the remnants of the shadowed forest vanished. The blinding light receded, leaving them kneeling on solid ground once again. This place was different, though—still. Silent. Empty.  

They wiped at their face with trembling hands, smearing the remnants of tears across their skin. The weight of what just happened pressed on their chest like a vice. The figure—the shifting, distorted *thing*—wasn’t gone. Not really. They could still feel its presence lingering like smoke in the back of their mind.  

*“You can’t run from me forever.”*  

Those words echoed inside Avery’s skull, pounding like a relentless drumbeat. Who—or what—was it? A figment of their broken psyche? Another trap set by the machine? Or…  

Their thoughts splintered.  

*What if it was something worse?*  

“No,” Avery muttered under their breath, shaking their head as they forced themselves to their feet. Their legs wobbled, weak from exhaustion and adrenaline, but they held. Somehow, they held.  

The path ahead stretched into a vast expanse of muted gray. The ground was hard and cold beneath Avery’s boots, resembling cracked stone or forgotten pavement. It spread out endlessly, meeting a horizon that shifted faintly, like heat waves shimmering in the distance.  

Avery squinted. Shapes loomed far away—dark silhouettes rising against the formless sky. Buildings, maybe.  

The sight made their pulse quicken.  

*Is this it? The real world?*  

No. That didn’t feel right.  

The air here was thin, unreal, as though the entire place was holding its breath. Avery turned slowly in a circle, scanning for anything—*anyone*—that could anchor them. But there was nothing.  

The silence buzzed.  

Their heart thumped louder in response, each beat reverberating inside their chest. Something was wrong here. The emptiness wasn’t peaceful. It was deliberate.  

*Manufactured.*  

Avery clenched their fists, forcing their mind to focus. “Think,” they muttered. “What did Elise say? Find the edges. Look for the cracks.”  

They glanced back over their shoulder, half-expecting the distorted figure to emerge from the void. But there was only empty space stretching into infinity.  

With a deep breath, Avery turned forward and started walking.  

Each step sent a hollow echo rippling across the cracked ground, as if the surface itself were fragile—waiting to splinter beneath them. The shapes on the horizon didn’t grow any closer, no matter how far Avery walked. It was as though the distance stretched to accommodate them, mocking their effort.  

“This isn’t real,” Avery whispered to themselves. “None of this is real.”  

The words should have grounded them, but instead, the buzzing in the silence grew louder, filling the space around them like a swarm of unseen insects. Avery’s skin prickled with unease.  

*Something’s watching.*  

They stopped abruptly, their breathing ragged. Turning their head slowly, they scanned the endless expanse again. At first, there was nothing. Just the cold, gray horizon.  

Then they saw it.  

A shadow.  

It wasn’t a figure this time—nothing with form or edges. Just a patch of darkness far to the left, shifting faintly against the cracked ground like an ink stain spreading across paper.  

Avery’s blood ran cold.  

The shadow began to move.  

It slid across the ground, soundless and smooth, its edges rippling as though alive. It wasn’t heading toward Avery directly—more like circling, closing in with agonizing patience.  

Panic flared in Avery’s chest, and they stumbled backward, their boots scraping against the stone. “No,” they muttered. “No, no, no—”  

They turned and ran.  

The horizon didn’t get any closer. The buildings—if that’s what they were—stayed fixed in the shimmering distance. The shadows chased them, spreading faster now, sweeping across the ground in jagged waves.  

*It’s coming for you.*  

Avery’s mind screamed as their legs pumped harder, their lungs burning with the effort. The buzzing silence had turned into a roar, vibrating through the air like the sound of something massive waking up.  

They risked a glance over their shoulder—  

The shadows were everywhere.  

A black tide rolled across the gray expanse, swallowing the ground in its path. It moved with terrifying intent, faster than Avery could run.  

“No!” Avery screamed, pushing their body harder. “Let me out!”  

Their voice cracked, swallowed by the roar.  

Suddenly—  

A glint of *something* appeared in their peripheral vision. To the right, half-hidden by the shifting air, a sliver of *light* cut through the gray.  

A crack.  

Avery veered toward it without thinking, their body moving on pure instinct. The ground trembled beneath them as the shadows surged closer, the roaring sound now deafening.  

“Come on!” Avery screamed, throwing themselves forward.  

The crack of light grew brighter—wider—spreading like a tear through fabric. The shadows lunged, the edge of the black tide reaching for Avery’s heels—  

And then Avery leaped.  

They dove headfirst into the light, their body plunging through the crack just as the shadows snapped shut behind them.  

There was no impact.  

Just blinding, searing brightness.  

---

## **Chapter 12: Through the Shadows (Part 2)**  

The blinding light enveloped Avery completely. For a moment, there was nothing—no sound, no sensation—just pure, overwhelming brightness that burned through their mind like a firestorm.  

Then, suddenly—  

They fell.  

Avery’s body tumbled through open air, disoriented and weightless, as though the world itself had been ripped out from under them. Wind roared in their ears, a chaotic howl that made it impossible to tell how far they were falling—or *where* they were falling to.  

It was endless. Infinite.  

And then—impact.  

The collision knocked the breath from Avery’s lungs as they hit solid ground, hard. Pain flared up their arms and into their ribs as they rolled onto their back, gasping for air. The world spun violently around them, blurring into streaks of gray, white, and shadow.  

For several long moments, Avery couldn’t move. They could only lie there, trembling, as they struggled to regain their breath.  

Slowly—too slowly—the spinning stopped. Avery blinked up at the sky. It wasn’t a sky at all, not really.  

Above them stretched a vast ceiling of reflective panels—shattered and fractured in places, but still glowing faintly with pale, flickering light. Each shard of glass reflected a different version of the world: distorted images of trees, corridors, buildings, and—  

*Themselves.*  

Avery’s chest tightened as they sat up, wincing at the soreness that spread through their body. The ground beneath them was smooth metal, cold against their fingertips, and surrounded by a shallow mist that hung close to the surface.  

They were inside some kind of massive structure—endless, empty, and echoing with the faint hum of unseen machines. The reflections above twisted and rippled, as though mocking their attempt to understand this place.  

“This isn’t real,” Avery whispered, though the words tasted like ash in their mouth.  

It didn’t matter how many times they said it—this place *felt* real. The cold metal beneath their hands was solid. The distant hum of the machines vibrated through their bones.  

Avery staggered to their feet, clutching their side as they scanned the area. The space was massive and formless, its walls obscured by mist. In the distance, they could make out faint structures—columns, maybe, or machines—but nothing moved.  

*It’s a trap.*  

The thought surfaced like a dark whisper in the back of Avery’s mind.  

“This place isn’t real,” they said again, louder this time.  

From somewhere in the mist, a voice answered.  

*“Are you sure about that?”*  

Avery froze.  

The voice echoed across the space, low and smooth, like a shadow given form. Slowly, Avery turned, scanning the fog for any sign of movement.  

Nothing.  

But then, the voice spoke again—closer this time.  

*“You’ve been running, Avery. Running from the truth. How long do you think you can keep it up?”*  

The hairs on the back of Avery’s neck stood on end. “Show yourself!” they shouted, their voice cracking.  

For a long moment, there was silence. Then—  

A shape emerged from the mist.  

At first, it was nothing more than a shadow—vague and formless. But as it stepped closer, it took shape. Human. Familiar.  

Avery’s blood ran cold as they stared at the figure.  

It was *them.*  

Another Avery.  

This version looked identical, but wrong somehow—its posture too straight, its movements too deliberate. The figure’s eyes glowed faintly with a cold, unnatural light, and its expression was unreadable.  

“What—” Avery stammered, stumbling back. “What is this?”  

The other Avery tilted its head, a faint, mocking smile spreading across its lips.  

*“I’m you,”* it said simply. *“The real you.”*  

“No,” Avery choked out, shaking their head violently. “No, you’re not. You’re not real.”  

The figure stepped closer, its footsteps soundless on the metal floor.  

*“Why are you denying it? I’m the part of you that you’ve been trying to bury. The memories you don’t want. The truths you’re afraid to face.”*  

“Stop!” Avery shouted, their voice raw. “You’re lying!”  

*“Am I?”* the figure whispered.  

Before Avery could react, the other version of them lunged forward, moving impossibly fast. Avery barely had time to stumble backward before cold, vice-like hands clamped onto their shoulders, pinning them in place.  

The figure’s face loomed inches from Avery’s, its glowing eyes locking onto theirs.  

*“Let me show you.”*  

A surge of pain shot through Avery’s skull, blinding and sharp, like a thousand needles piercing their mind at once. They screamed, falling to their knees as memories—fragmented and disjointed—flooded their consciousness.  

**Blood. Screaming. A dark room filled with machines. A figure lying on a table—silent, unmoving. Their own hands stained red.**  

Avery clutched their head, their vision swimming as the memories fractured and reformed, each one worse than the last.  

“Stop!” they sobbed. “Please—stop!”  

The other Avery crouched down in front of them, its glowing eyes boring into Avery’s soul.  

*“You wanted to forget, remember? You thought you could erase the truth. But you can’t. It’s still here. I’m still here.”*  

The figure leaned closer, its voice dropping to a whisper.  

*“You’ll never escape me.”*  

With a final surge of force, Avery shoved the figure back. The glowing-eyed doppelgänger stumbled, its form flickering like static before dissolving into mist.  

Avery collapsed forward, gasping for breath. Their entire body shook, and their mind felt raw—like it had been torn open and left to bleed.  

For a long time, they lay there, unmoving.  

When they finally lifted their head, the mist had thinned, and the distant hum of machines had grown louder. The reflections above shimmered violently, the images fractured beyond recognition.  

Avery forced themselves to their feet, swaying unsteadily. The other Avery’s words lingered, poisoning their thoughts.  

*“You’ll never escape me.”*  

Avery swallowed hard, their fists clenching at their sides.  

“No,” they whispered. “I will.”  

With that, they turned toward the sound of the machines and started walking—each step heavier than the last.  

---


 


## **Chapter 13: A World of Illusions (Part 1)**  

The hallway outside the secret facility twisted unnaturally as Avery stumbled forward, every step weighed down by something more than exhaustion. The flickering overhead lights cast jagged shadows on the concrete walls, making everything feel warped, as if the very air around them had begun to fold in on itself.  

Their breaths came quick and shallow, Elise’s footsteps echoing beside them. She was close—always close—but felt like a ghost moving just out of sync with reality. Avery kept their gaze fixed straight ahead, refusing to look at the shifting edges of the walls or the doors that now seemed to melt into the concrete.  

“What did you do back there?” Elise’s voice broke through the strained silence, her words sharp and accusing.  

Avery swallowed, their throat dry as sandpaper. “I didn’t—”  

“Don’t say you didn’t do anything!” Elise snapped, stopping suddenly. Avery turned to look at her, and for a moment, something was off about her face. The shadows clung to her skin too tightly, like ink bleeding into the edges of her features.  

Avery blinked, and it was gone. Elise was just Elise again—frustrated, scared, and angry—but Avery felt a cold shiver crawl up their spine.  

“This isn’t me,” Avery muttered, more to themselves than to Elise. “This isn’t real. It’s the device. It’s… in everything.”  

Elise stepped forward, her expression softening slightly. “You’re not making sense. I need you to focus. We need to get out of here before—”  

A noise interrupted her.  

It was faint at first—a slow, rhythmic tapping, like footsteps echoing far down the corridor. Avery’s blood ran cold as the sound grew louder. Closer.  

*Tap… tap… tap.*  

They turned toward the source, the far end of the hallway swallowed in darkness. The lights above them flickered violently now, each pulse of darkness stretching longer than the last. Avery felt a familiar pressure in their skull, like invisible fingers pressing deep into their brain.  

“You hear that, right?” Avery whispered.  

Elise nodded, her eyes fixed on the darkness. She reached for Avery’s arm and tugged gently. “Come on. We’re not waiting to see what that is.”  

The two of them started walking again, faster this time. Avery’s heart pounded in rhythm with their steps, the tapping behind them seeming to match their pace perfectly. It didn’t slow. It didn’t speed up. It just… followed.  

As they rounded a corner, Avery nearly froze.  

The corridor stretched ahead in a perfect, endless line, every door along its length identical—gray, windowless, and slightly warped. The fluorescent lights buzzed like angry insects, their glow paling as though drained of energy. Avery realized with growing horror that the hallway was **too** straight. Too perfect.  

“What is this place?” Elise murmured, her voice barely audible.  

Avery didn’t answer. The question hung heavy in the air, unanswerable and irrelevant, because Avery knew there was no “place” anymore. Not really. The walls were an illusion. The hallway wasn’t a hallway at all.  

It was a trap.  

“Wait—stop!” Avery yanked Elise back just as she reached for one of the doors.  

Elise spun toward them, her expression confused and irritated. “Avery, what are you—?”  

“Look.” Avery pointed at the door.  

At first glance, it was unremarkable—steel gray like all the others. But as they watched, faint ripples pulsed across its surface, like a reflection on disturbed water. Avery squinted, their pulse quickening as a shape formed just beneath the surface of the door.  

It was a hand.  

A human hand, pressed against the other side.  

The outline of fingers stretched out, pressing harder, harder, until the steel seemed to *bulge*.  

Elise took a step back. “Jesus Christ.”  

The hand began to twist, its shape warping into something unnatural. The fingers elongated, sharp at the tips like claws. Another hand appeared beside it, then another. And then came the face.  

A faceless, hollow impression of a head pushed against the door from the inside, its blank features impossibly smooth. The mouth stretched wide, a silent scream distorting its shape.  

Avery stumbled back, grabbing Elise’s arm. “We have to move. Now.”  

The tapping sound grew louder—closer—pounding now like hammer blows against the floor.  

*Tap. Tap. Tap. TAP.*  

Avery turned and sprinted down the hallway, dragging Elise with them. They didn’t dare look back, but they could feel it—the tapping, the bulging doors, the **thing** following them. The sound filled the air, deafening and relentless, as the walls around them began to *melt*.  

“Avery!” Elise shouted.  

Ahead of them, the hallway split into two paths—identical and impossible to tell apart. Avery skidded to a stop, their chest heaving as they looked left, then right.  

“Which way?” Elise demanded.  

Avery’s mind raced, sweat dripping into their eyes. Both hallways looked the same, each stretching into a void of flickering lights and rippling shadows.  

“You have to choose!” Elise grabbed Avery’s shoulders, her grip hard enough to snap them out of their daze.  

Avery turned left.  

“This way!”  

They ran.  

The hallway twisted, curving in ways that shouldn’t have been possible. Avery’s legs burned, but the tapping sound followed, never fading. It felt as though the entire world around them was **watching**, bending and shifting just to keep them trapped.  

Finally, they reached another door at the end of the corridor. This one was different—heavy, reinforced, with a small circular window set into its center. Light—real, natural light—spilled through the glass, and Avery felt a flicker of hope stab through the haze of fear.  

“Go!” Elise shouted, pushing Avery forward.  

Avery grabbed the door handle and pulled with all their strength. It didn’t budge.  

“No!” Avery gritted their teeth and yanked again. “It’s locked!”  

Elise slammed her shoulder against it, the two of them straining to force it open. Behind them, the tapping stopped.  

The sudden silence was worse.  

Avery turned their head slowly, dread pooling in their stomach.  

The figure was there. Standing in the middle of the hallway.  

Faceless. Still. Waiting.  

The air grew heavy, and Avery’s vision swam as the figure raised a single hand, pointing directly at them.  

The door behind Avery suddenly gave way, the handle slipping from their grip as it swung open. Bright light flooded the hallway, blinding them. Elise grabbed Avery’s arm and pulled them through, slamming the door shut behind them.  

Avery stumbled to the ground, gasping for breath. The sound of the tapping was gone, replaced by the gentle hum of… something.  

When they opened their eyes, they froze.  

They were back in the lab.  

Again.  

The console glowed faintly, waiting. The device sat at the center of the room, polished and unassuming.  

Elise cursed under her breath, her voice shaking. “Avery… what’s happening?”  

Avery didn’t respond. They couldn’t.  

Because this time, the screen already had a message waiting for them:  

**Welcome back, Avery.**  

---

## **Chapter 13: A World of Illusions (Part 2)**  

The words on the screen—**Welcome back, Avery**—seemed to pulse, as though alive. Avery’s chest tightened, their breath caught in their throat. It was waiting for them. *Watching.*  

Elise staggered to her feet, running a trembling hand through her hair. “This isn’t happening,” she muttered, her voice thin and broken. “We made it out. I know we did.”  

Avery stood slowly, their legs unsteady, their gaze locked on the console. “No,” they whispered. “We didn’t. It’s pulling us back in.”  

Elise turned to them sharply. “What do you mean ‘pulling us back’? What the hell is this, Avery?!”  

Avery shook their head, trying to steady the whirlwind of thoughts in their mind. “The device. The signal. It’s not just data, Elise—it’s **alive**. It’s rewriting everything. Us, this place, reality itself. Every time we try to escape, it resets us. Brings us back to… here.”  

Elise froze, her face pale. “A loop,” she murmured.  

Avery nodded, the truth settling over them like ice. “It’s learning. Adapting. The more we fight it, the stronger it gets.”  

Elise let out a short, bitter laugh, the sound brittle and hollow. “So what are we supposed to do? Give up? Let it win?”  

“I don’t know,” Avery admitted, their voice shaking. “But we can’t keep running. It’ll just pull us back.”  

Elise turned away, pacing the length of the lab. The hum of the machines seemed louder now, vibrating deep in Avery’s bones, as though the signal was spreading through the very walls.  

“You’re saying this thing—this *signal*—is creating all of this?” Elise asked, gesturing to the lab. “The hallways. The figure. Even Marcus?”  

Avery hesitated. “I don’t know if it’s creating them, or if they’re… pieces of us. Fractured memories. Twisted versions of reality.”  

“Pieces of us?” Elise’s voice cracked, her face twisted in disbelief. “That’s insane, Avery.”  

“Is it?” Avery shot back, their voice rising. “After everything we’ve seen? The device was never just a tool, Elise. It’s doing something to us. To *me*.”  

The console screen flickered, pulling their attention back. A new message appeared, the words jagged and broken:  

**YOU CAN’T ESCAPE YOURSELF.**  

Elise’s breath caught. “What does that mean?”  

Avery stared at the screen, the words searing into their mind. *You can’t escape yourself.*  

Suddenly, the lab lights flickered, and the hum grew deafening. Avery clutched their head, the pressure building in their skull, sharp and relentless. The walls around them rippled, the edges distorting like heat waves.  

“Avery!” Elise’s voice sounded distant, warped, like it was being pulled through water.  

Avery squeezed their eyes shut, but it didn’t help. Images flashed across the darkness—fragments of memories, distorted and out of order.  

The faceless figure.  

Marcus’s warnings.  

The child’s laughter.  

The sound of glass shattering.  

“Avery!” Elise shouted again, and this time, Avery felt her hands gripping their shoulders, shaking them. “Snap out of it!”  

The pressure in Avery’s skull released all at once, and they gasped, collapsing forward. Elise caught them, helping them stay upright.  

“What the hell was that?” Elise whispered, her voice trembling.  

Avery blinked, their vision slowly clearing. “It’s the signal,” they rasped. “It’s breaking us down. Layer by layer.”  

Elise looked toward the console again, her expression hardening. “Then we need to shut it down.”  

Avery’s stomach turned. “How? It’s everywhere. It’s in the device, the systems… us.”  

“There has to be a way,” Elise insisted, her voice sharp with desperation. “There’s always a way.”  

Before Avery could respond, the lab door creaked open.  

They both froze, the sound splitting the silence like a knife. The door swung inward slowly, the hallway beyond bathed in darkness.  

Elise grabbed Avery’s arm. “Don’t.”  

But Avery couldn’t help it. They stepped forward, peering into the blackness.  

“Marcus?” Avery called out, though their voice was barely above a whisper.  

For a moment, there was nothing. Just silence.  

Then—  

*Tap. Tap. Tap.*  

Avery staggered back, the sound sending chills through their body. Elise grabbed their arm again, pulling them away from the door. “It’s coming,” she whispered.  

The lights in the lab flickered again, the hum of the machines rising to an unnatural pitch. Avery turned to the console just as another message appeared on the screen:  

**IT’S TOO LATE.**  

A sharp, metallic screech echoed through the lab, and Avery spun around to see the faceless figure step through the doorway.  

It moved slowly, deliberately, its blank head tilted slightly as though studying them. The shadows seemed to ripple and stretch in its wake, swallowing the light.  

“Run!” Elise shouted, pulling Avery toward the far side of the room.  

The figure didn’t follow immediately. It simply stood there, watching. Waiting.  

Avery’s heart pounded as they reached the far wall. Elise frantically searched for an escape—anything that would get them out—but the walls were solid, unyielding.  

“We’re trapped,” she muttered, panic rising in her voice.  

Avery turned back to the figure. It had taken a step closer now, its movements unnaturally smooth, as though it were gliding across the floor.  

“We have to face it,” Avery said suddenly, their voice shaking but resolute.  

Elise stared at them. “Are you out of your mind?”  

“Running doesn’t work,” Avery replied, their gaze locked on the figure. “It just brings us back here. We have to stop it. Somehow.”  

The figure took another step, the shadows pooling closer. Avery felt the pressure return to their skull, heavier this time, like something trying to push its way inside.  

*You can’t escape yourself.*  

Avery clenched their fists, forcing themselves to stand tall. “What do you want?” they demanded, their voice echoing through the lab.  

The figure stopped. For a moment, everything was still—the shadows, the hum, even the flickering lights.  

Then, it tilted its head again, and for the first time, it spoke.  

The voice was Avery’s own.  

“I want you to remember.”  

The words hit Avery like a physical blow, knocking the air from their lungs.  

Elise grabbed their arm, her voice frantic. “Avery, don’t listen to it!”  

The lights flared violently, blinding them both. Avery squeezed their eyes shut as the hum crescendoed into a deafening roar.  

And then—  

Silence.  

When Avery opened their eyes, they were alone.  

The lab was gone. The figure was gone.  

They stood in a vast, empty space, the ground beneath their feet smooth and white, stretching infinitely in all directions. The air was still, heavy with an unnatural calm.  

A voice echoed through the void, soft and familiar.  

“You already know.”  

Avery turned slowly, and there, standing a few feet away, was themselves.  

The other Avery smiled faintly, their black eyes glinting like mirrors.  

“Welcome back.”  

---




## **Chapter 14: Fractured Truths (Part 1)**  

Avery stared at the version of themselves standing a few feet away, their breath caught in their chest. It was uncanny—perfect in every way—except for the black, empty eyes that seemed to swallow the space around them.  

“Welcome back,” the doppelgänger said softly, the words dripping with something Avery couldn’t name. Its voice was calm, steady—*their* voice—but hearing it from the other made Avery’s skin crawl.  

“What is this?” Avery whispered, fists clenching at their sides. “Where am I?”  

The other Avery tilted their head, their smile widening ever so slightly. “You already know.”  

Avery’s stomach twisted, that familiar phrase echoing through their mind like a persistent echo. *You already know.*  

“I don’t!” Avery snapped, the frustration boiling over. “I don’t know anything. What is this place? Why are you here?”  

The doppelgänger took a single step forward, and the ground beneath their feet rippled like water. “This place is what remains when you strip everything else away,” they said, their tone almost gentle. “The truth, Avery. Or what’s left of it.”  

Avery took a step back instinctively, their pulse hammering in their ears. “This isn’t real. None of this is real.”  

“Isn’t it?” The doppelgänger spread their arms, motioning to the endless white void surrounding them. “You can tell yourself that, if it helps. But it won’t change what you are.”  

Avery’s throat tightened. “What I am?”  

The other Avery nodded slowly. “You’re the one who let this happen. You’re the one who broke the world.”  

“Shut up!” Avery shouted, their voice cracking. The words stung, hitting too close to the thoughts already clawing at the edges of their mind.  

“You built the device,” the doppelgänger continued, unfazed. “You tested it. You ignored the warnings. And now you’re stuck here, just like the rest of us.”  

Avery’s mind reeled, their vision blurring with the weight of the accusation. “No. No, I didn’t—”  

“You did,” the doppelgänger interrupted, their voice sharper now. “You did this. You’re the reason everything is breaking.”  

The ground beneath Avery trembled, as if the world itself were reacting to the truth. “I didn’t know,” Avery whispered, their voice weak. “I didn’t know this would happen.”  

The other Avery stepped closer, their black eyes locking onto Avery’s. “But you did, didn’t you?”  

Avery shook their head, tears burning at the corners of their eyes. “No!”  

“You ignored the signs.” The doppelgänger’s voice grew louder, the air around them vibrating with an unseen pressure. “You ignored Marcus. You ignored Elise. You even ignored yourself. Because you wanted to believe you were doing something good.”  

The words hit Avery like blows, each one striking deeper. They stumbled backward, their knees threatening to give out. “I didn’t… I didn’t mean for this…”  

“But it doesn’t matter what you meant.” The doppelgänger’s voice was cold now, devoid of the gentleness it held before. “This is where it ends. This is where you face what you’ve done.”  

The air grew heavy, the white void around them dimming, as though darkness were seeping in from the edges. Avery looked around wildly, their chest tight with panic.  

“What is happening?” they gasped, struggling to breathe.  

“The walls are closing in,” the doppelgänger said, their voice echoing ominously. “It’s almost over now, Avery.”  

The darkness crept closer, tendrils of shadow stretching across the ground like cracks in a pane of glass. Avery felt the pull—like something inside the void wanted to drag them under.  

“You can’t run from it anymore,” the other Avery whispered, their black eyes glinting with cruel certainty. “The truth is here.”  

The shadows reached Avery’s feet, curling around their shoes like cold, grasping fingers. Avery tried to step back, but the ground was gone—there was nowhere left to go.  

“Stop!” Avery screamed, their voice raw and desperate. “Please, stop!”  

The doppelgänger only smiled, their expression dark and knowing. “You can’t erase the truth, Avery.”  

The darkness surged forward, swallowing the space around them. Avery’s vision blurred, the doppelgänger’s face fading into the void, until all that remained was the sound of their voice.  

“You already know.”  

And then—  

Nothing.  

---  

When Avery woke, they were lying on a cold, hard surface. Their head throbbed, the ache radiating deep into their skull. For a moment, they didn’t move, too afraid to open their eyes and see what waited for them.  

The sound of distant humming—soft and mechanical—reached their ears, breaking through the haze of silence. Slowly, they opened their eyes.  

They were back in the lab.  

The console flickered softly, its glow the only light in the room. The device sat on the table where it always had, silent and polished, as though none of it—*any of it*—had ever happened.  

Avery pushed themselves upright, their limbs shaking from the effort. The lab was empty. Elise was gone. Marcus was gone. The faceless figure was gone.  

It was just them.  

And the device.  

“No,” Avery whispered, their voice hoarse. “Not again.”  

They stumbled to their feet, clutching the edge of the table to steady themselves. The console screen blinked once, then twice, before a single line of text appeared.  

**Are you ready to remember?**  

Avery stared at the words, their pulse pounding in their ears.  

*No.*  

They weren’t ready.  

But they knew they didn’t have a choice.  

---  

## **Chapter 14: Fractured Truths (Part 2)**  

The words on the screen—**Are you ready to remember?**—blinked slowly, as if taunting Avery with the question. Their hands trembled as they gripped the edge of the table, the weight of it pressing down like an invisible force.  

“Remember what?” Avery muttered, their voice barely above a whisper. They knew they wouldn’t get an answer. Not from the machine. Not from anyone.  

The hum of the lab equipment grew louder, vibrating deep in Avery’s chest. The screen flickered again, and new text appeared:  

**It started with you.**  

Avery’s pulse quickened, sweat pooling at the back of their neck. “No,” they said, shaking their head. “No, I didn’t… I didn’t mean for any of this.”  

The device, silent and polished, seemed to stare back at them. Memories began to push their way to the surface—shards of images and sounds—unwelcome and unstoppable. Avery squeezed their eyes shut, trying to push them back down, but it was like holding back a flood.  

*The laughter of a child.*  

*Glass shattering.*  

*The lab, glowing with monitors, Elise’s face lit up with grim determination.*  

The sound of a door opening behind them jolted Avery back to the present. They spun around, their heart in their throat.  

Elise stood there, her face pale, her eyes dark with exhaustion. She looked… wrong, somehow. Like a version of herself that didn’t quite belong.  

“Elise?” Avery said cautiously.  

Elise didn’t answer right away. She stepped forward, her movements slow and deliberate. “You’ve seen it now, haven’t you?”  

Avery’s chest tightened. “Seen what?”  

“The truth,” Elise replied, her voice soft but edged with something darker. “It’s breaking through, Avery. You can’t keep running from it.”  

“This isn’t real,” Avery said, their voice cracking. “You’re not real.”  

Elise smiled faintly, and Avery felt the ground tilt beneath them. “That’s what you told yourself, isn’t it? That none of it was real. That it wasn’t your fault.”  

The room felt smaller now, the walls closing in. Avery stumbled back, shaking their head. “Stop. You’re not Elise.”  

The lights in the lab dimmed, plunging half the room into shadow. Elise’s form seemed to blur at the edges, the darkness clinging to her like oil.  

“Do you want to know what you did?” Elise whispered, taking another step closer.  

“No!” Avery shouted, their voice ragged. “I didn’t do anything!”  

But the memories were already surfacing. They felt as though they were drowning in them, each one more vivid than the last.  

---  

*The first test had been a success—or so Avery had thought.*  

They had stood at the console, Elise and Marcus watching as the MERI Device hummed to life. The subject—a man whose face Avery couldn’t quite remember—had sat perfectly still in the chair, electrodes pressed to his temples.  

“It’s working,” Elise had said, her voice tight with awe. “Look at the readings. We’re erasing it.”  

Avery had smiled then, relief washing over them. It had been a breakthrough. Years of work, sleepless nights, and relentless failures had finally paid off. The subject’s trauma—his unbearable memories—were being wiped clean.  

But something had happened.  

The readings spiked. The man’s breathing grew shallow, his body jerking violently against the restraints.  

“Shut it down!” Marcus had shouted.  

Avery had hesitated, staring at the console as the numbers flashed red. They’d thought it was a glitch—something minor, something they could fix. But by the time they pressed the emergency shutdown, it was too late.  

The man had gone still.  

Too still.  

Avery remembered staring at his face, at his blank, unseeing eyes. Elise had been shouting something, but the words were muffled, lost beneath the deafening hum of the device.  

“What did you do, Avery?” Marcus had said, his voice shaking with anger.  

Avery had looked down at the console, at the pulsing anomaly in the data. It shouldn’t have been there. It hadn’t been there before. But it was now—growing, spreading—like something alive.  

And Avery had realized, in that moment, what they had unleashed.  

---  

The memory shattered, and Avery collapsed to their knees in the lab, gasping for breath. The hum of the device seemed louder now, vibrating through the floor, through their bones.  

“I tried to stop it,” Avery whispered, their voice hoarse. “I didn’t know…”  

“You knew,” Elise’s voice said softly.  

Avery looked up, their vision blurred with tears. Elise stood over them, her features distorted now, as though the darkness was eating away at her edges.  

“You knew what it could become,” she continued. “And you did it anyway.”  

“No,” Avery sobbed, their hands clenching into fists. “I didn’t mean for this to happen. I didn’t—”  

The lights flickered violently, and the walls around them rippled, the lab dissolving into shadow. Avery staggered to their feet, backing away as Elise’s form began to blur and shift.  

“You can’t hide from yourself,” she said, her voice deepening, becoming layered—*inhuman*.  

The last of Elise’s features melted away, leaving behind a familiar form.  

Avery.  

The doppelgänger stood in her place now, its black eyes glinting like endless voids. It smiled faintly, its expression cold and cruel.  

“You built the device,” it said, taking a step forward. “You opened the door.”  

Avery stumbled back, shaking uncontrollably. “Stay away from me!”  

The doppelgänger tilted its head, its black eyes never leaving Avery’s. “You can’t run anymore. It’s time to remember.”  

The hum of the device grew deafening, the darkness pressing in from all sides. Avery felt it—pulling at them, dragging them down into the shadows.  

“Stop!” Avery screamed.  

The doppelgänger reached out, its voice a whisper that echoed in Avery’s mind.  

*“You already know.”*  

Avery’s vision went black, the world collapsing around them.  

And then—  

Silence.  

---

When Avery opened their eyes, they were no longer in the lab.  

They stood in a field bathed in golden light, the air thick with the scent of wildflowers. The hum of the device was gone, replaced by the distant sound of birdsong and the gentle whisper of the wind.  

For a moment, Avery didn’t move. They just stood there, staring at the impossible beauty of the world around them.  

Then, slowly, they turned.  

A small house sat at the edge of the field, its windows glowing faintly with light. Avery’s chest tightened as they stared at it, memories pushing their way to the surface.  

They knew this place.  

They had been here before.  

“Come inside,” a voice called softly.  

It was a child’s voice—familiar, distant, and impossibly clear. Avery’s hands trembled as they took a step toward the house, their heart pounding in their chest.  

The door creaked open as they approached, revealing nothing but darkness beyond.  

*“You already know,”* the voice whispered again, pulling Avery forward.  

And this time, Avery stepped inside.  

---



## **Chapter 15: The Puppet Strings (Part 1)**  

The door closed behind Avery with a soft click, the sound far louder in the silence that swallowed them whole. The field, the wind, the golden light—it was gone.  

They stood at the threshold of the house, staring into absolute darkness. The air was still, heavy with an almost tangible weight, like they had stepped into a void where time itself had stopped.  

*“Come inside,”* the child’s voice echoed again, soft and melodic, pulling Avery deeper into the dark.  

Avery hesitated, their body trembling with every shallow breath. “Where are you?” their voice cracked, hoarse from fear and exhaustion.  

Silence answered.  

The only thing visible was the faint outline of a hallway stretching ahead, lit by a dull, flickering light. The walls were familiar—faded wallpaper, peeling at the edges, like a home forgotten and left to decay. Avery’s steps were slow and cautious as they moved forward, the floor creaking beneath their weight.  

With each step, Avery felt it: the sensation of being watched. Eyes they couldn’t see lingered on their back, heavy and unrelenting. They glanced over their shoulder, but there was nothing—only the door they had entered through, now impossibly far away, as though the house itself were stretching around them.  

A shadow moved ahead.  

Avery froze, their breath catching in their throat. For a heartbeat, the hallway flickered as though seen through a broken screen. A figure stood at the far end—small, hunched, and motionless.  

“Who’s there?” Avery whispered.  

The figure didn’t move.  

Avery’s pulse thundered in their ears as they stepped closer, drawn toward the shape despite every instinct screaming at them to turn back. The dim light sharpened its outline—a child, standing still with their back turned, facing a door at the end of the hallway.  

A memory, sharp and sudden, pushed its way into Avery’s mind.  

*That door. That figure.*  

They had been here before.  

“No,” Avery whispered, shaking their head. “This can’t be happening.”  

The child shifted slightly, their shoulders rising and falling with slow, deliberate breaths. The sound of laughter—soft, echoing, and far too familiar—filled the hallway, sending icy tendrils of dread curling through Avery’s chest.  

The child turned.  

It was Avery.  

A younger version of themselves—no older than ten—dressed in a worn, oversized sweater and scuffed shoes. Their face was pale, their eyes wide and glassy, but their mouth curled into a small, unnatural smile.  

“Hi, Avery,” the child said softly, their voice clear and cold, cutting through the stillness like a blade.  

Avery staggered back, shaking uncontrollably. “No. You’re not real.”  

The child cocked their head to the side, the smile never wavering. “You don’t remember, do you?”  

“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Avery choked out, their voice barely audible.  

“You do,” the child replied, their tone singsong and cruel. “You just don’t want to.”  

The hallway flickered again, the walls warping and twisting like they were alive. The child’s form shimmered with it, their edges blurring, their glassy eyes fixed on Avery.  

“You opened the door,” the child whispered, their voice layered now—more than one voice speaking in unison. “You let it out.”  

Avery pressed their hands to their head, the pressure building behind their eyes. “Stop!”  

The house seemed to respond. The walls groaned and stretched, the wallpaper peeling back like rotting skin. The floorboards buckled beneath Avery’s feet as though something enormous was shifting just below the surface.  

“You let it in,” the child continued, their voice rising. “You let it inside you, and now it’s everywhere. It’s you, Avery. It’s all you.”  

The shadows at the edges of the hallway crawled closer, tendrils of darkness reaching for Avery, pulling at their feet, their legs, their mind.  

“Please,” Avery begged, their voice breaking. “Stop. I didn’t mean to—I didn’t know.”  

The child stepped closer, their smile widening, the glassy blackness of their eyes swallowing what remained of their face. “But you did. And now you’re going to remember everything.”  

The shadows surged forward. Avery felt them wrap around their body, dragging them down, suffocating them in cold, unrelenting darkness.  

And then—  

---  

Avery woke with a gasp, their body jerking upright.  

They were back in the lab.  

The harsh fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, flickering slightly, their glow cold and unfeeling. The air smelled of metal and antiseptic. Avery’s heart pounded, their shirt soaked through with sweat.  

For a long moment, they sat there, gasping for breath, their mind spinning. It had felt real. *Too real.*  

But it wasn’t. It couldn’t have been.  

A voice broke the silence. “Avery.”  

Avery flinched, their head snapping toward the sound. Marcus stood at the edge of the lab, his face drawn and tired, his dark eyes fixed on Avery with a mixture of relief and wariness.  

“You’re awake,” Marcus said quietly.  

Avery stared at him, disoriented. “Where… where am I?”  

“You’re back in the lab,” Marcus replied, stepping closer. “We found you collapsed outside the facility. You’ve been out for hours.”  

Avery ran a trembling hand through their hair, trying to process. “The house,” they whispered. “The child… It was me. It said—”  

“Hey,” Marcus interrupted sharply, crouching down so he was eye-level with Avery. “Focus. Whatever you saw, it wasn’t real. Do you hear me? The signal’s messing with your head.”  

Avery shook their head, their vision swimming. “No. It’s real. It’s always been real. I opened the door, Marcus. I let it out.”  

Marcus’s jaw tightened. “What door, Avery? What are you talking about?”  

Avery looked at him, tears welling in their eyes. “The device. It’s not just erasing memories—it’s taking something else. Pieces of us. Fracturing reality. And it’s inside me, Marcus. It’s always been inside me.”  

Marcus grabbed Avery’s shoulders, his grip firm but steady. “Listen to me. Whatever this is—whatever the device is doing—it can be stopped. We can stop it. But you need to keep it together, Avery. Don’t let it win.”  

Avery stared at him, searching his face for something—*anything*—to hold onto. Marcus’s expression was hard, determined, but there was something in his eyes that Avery couldn’t quite place.  

“Why are you here, Marcus?” Avery whispered suddenly. “Why did you come back?”  

Marcus’s gaze flickered, just for a second, but the hesitation was there. “Because you need me.”  

Avery frowned, their chest tightening. “That’s not an answer.”  

Marcus stood abruptly, turning toward the console. “We don’t have time for this. The Corporation knows what’s happening. If we don’t act now, they’ll bury this—and us—before we can stop it.”  

Avery’s head spun as they watched Marcus move toward the console. The words of the child echoed in their mind. *You let it out. It’s all you.*  

“Marcus,” Avery said weakly, their voice trembling. “What if we can’t stop it?”  

Marcus paused, his back to Avery. “Then we don’t walk away.”  

The screen on the console flickered to life. Avery stared at it, their pulse quickening as familiar text appeared:  

**Welcome back, Avery.**  

And beneath it, a new line of text blinked slowly:  

**The truth is waiting.**  

---  

## **Chapter 15: The Puppet Strings (Part 2)**  

The words on the screen—**The truth is waiting**—seemed to pulse in time with Avery’s heartbeat. They couldn’t tear their gaze away, as though the message were a living thing pulling them closer, deeper.  

Marcus stood beside the console, his hand hovering over the controls. “Avery, focus.”  

Avery blinked hard, their thoughts scattered, the child’s voice still echoing in their mind. *You let it out. It’s all you.*  

“Marcus…” Avery swallowed hard, struggling to steady their voice. “The device. It’s not just corrupting memories, is it? It’s breaking something deeper. *Us.*”  

Marcus froze. For a heartbeat, he said nothing, his face unreadable. Then, slowly, he turned to look at Avery.  

“Why are you saying that?” His voice was low, cautious, like he was speaking to someone unstable.  

“Because I can feel it,” Avery replied, pushing themselves shakily to their feet. “It’s inside me. It’s rewriting everything—who I am, what’s real. I opened the door, Marcus, and now…”  

Marcus’s gaze hardened. “Now you’re letting it win. That’s what it wants. To break you.”  

Avery took a step back. “You’re not listening. I saw it. I saw myself, Marcus. It told me the truth. The device isn’t just erasing memories—it’s replacing them. Fracturing reality. Turning us into something… else.”  

Marcus let out a sharp breath, running a hand through his hair. “You’re losing it, Avery. You’ve been exposed to the signal for too long. That’s why the lines are blurring. That’s why you’re seeing things that aren’t there.”  

“They’re real,” Avery insisted, their voice rising. “You know they’re real, don’t you? You’ve seen it too. The glitches. The *shadows*. The pieces that don’t fit.”  

Marcus turned back to the console abruptly, avoiding Avery’s gaze. “We don’t have time for this.”  

“Marcus!” Avery shouted, their voice raw. “Why won’t you answer me? What aren’t you telling me?”  

Marcus’s shoulders tensed, but he didn’t turn around. “You don’t want the truth, Avery. Trust me.”  

“Yes, I do!” Avery snapped. “I need to know. I need to understand what’s happening to me.”  

The hum of the device grew louder, vibrating through the floor like a heartbeat. The console screen flickered again, new words replacing the old ones.  

**HE KNOWS.**  

Avery’s blood ran cold. “Marcus…”  

Marcus turned slowly, his face pale, his dark eyes shadowed by something Avery couldn’t name. “Don’t listen to it.”  

The screen blinked again:  

**HE LIED TO YOU.**  

Avery staggered back, their breath quickening. “What is it talking about?”  

“Nothing,” Marcus said quickly, his voice sharp. “It’s trying to manipulate you.”  

“You knew,” Avery whispered, their voice trembling. “You knew what the device was doing. You knew, and you didn’t stop it.”  

Marcus stepped toward Avery, his hands raised as though calming a wild animal. “Avery, listen to me—”  

“Don’t!” Avery shouted, backing away. “How long have you known? How much of this is *your fault*?”  

The screen’s glow grew brighter, the words flashing more urgently.  

**HE WAS THERE FROM THE BEGINNING.**  

Avery stared at Marcus, horror dawning on their face. “You were there,” they said, their voice almost a whisper. “You were part of it.”  

Marcus’s expression faltered, the mask he wore cracking just enough to let something darker bleed through. “It wasn’t supposed to happen like this.”  

Avery’s mind reeled. “You knew what this device could do. You knew what it would become.”  

Marcus’s jaw tightened. “I didn’t have a choice.”  

“You *always* had a choice!” Avery shouted. “You could have stopped this. You could have warned me!”  

“It’s bigger than you,” Marcus snapped, his voice hard now, almost cruel. “Bigger than me. You think you’re the only one who’s been used? The Corporation has been pulling the strings from the start. You and I are both pawns in their game.”  

Avery stared at him, their chest heaving. “You lied to me.”  

Marcus took a step closer, his voice softening. “I tried to protect you. But it’s too late now. You’ve seen too much. It’s inside you, Avery. Just like it’s inside me.”  

The words hit Avery like a physical blow. “Inside you?”  

Marcus nodded slowly, his eyes dark and unreadable. “The signal. The glitches. We’re infected, Avery. You can’t undo it.”  

Avery shook their head, stumbling back. “No. You’re lying.”  

“I wish I were,” Marcus said quietly. “But you felt it, didn’t you? The way reality shifts. The way it pulls at you.”  

Avery’s legs felt weak, the room spinning around them. “It’s not too late,” they whispered, more to themselves than to Marcus. “We can still stop it.”  

Marcus’s face darkened. “Stop it? You don’t even know what *it* is. The device isn’t broken, Avery. It’s doing exactly what it was designed to do.”  

A chill crawled through Avery’s body, their hands shaking uncontrollably. “What are you talking about?”  

Marcus looked at them, his expression unreadable. “You’ll see soon enough.”  

The console buzzed loudly, and the screen’s glow intensified, casting long, jagged shadows across the room. The hum of the device grew deafening, like a roar building deep within the earth. Avery clutched their head, the pressure behind their eyes spiking like needles.  

“Make it stop!” Avery screamed.  

Marcus didn’t move. He stood perfectly still, watching as the room distorted around them, the edges of the lab rippling like a mirage.  

The screen flashed again, its message a single command:  

**REMEMBER.**  

The hum reached its peak, and Avery’s vision blurred. They staggered forward, their knees buckling as images flooded their mind—fractured, fragmented, and impossible to piece together.  

A woman’s voice—Elise’s voice—screaming.  

The sound of glass shattering.  

The figure of the child, standing in the doorway.  

The console, flashing red warnings.  

And Marcus, standing beside them, watching it all.  

“No!” Avery sobbed, their voice breaking. “No, no, no!”  

The light from the screen flared violently, blinding them. Avery fell to the floor, their hands pressed to their head as the device’s hum vibrated through their entire body.  

“You let it in,” Marcus’s voice whispered through the chaos.  

And then—  

Silence.  

When Avery opened their eyes, they were alone.  

The lab was gone.  

They stood in the center of an endless, empty void, the darkness stretching infinitely in all directions. A single, faint hum lingered in the air, like a heartbeat at the edge of hearing.  

Ahead of them, a figure appeared.  

It was Avery.  

The doppelgänger smiled, its black eyes glinting.  

“Now you understand,” it said softly.  

The darkness closed in.  

---

### **Act IV: The Collapse** 

## **Chapter 16: Erasing the Self (Part 1)**  

The darkness stretched infinitely, vast and unbroken. Avery stood alone, suspended in a void where there was no up, no down—no sense of direction at all.  

A distant hum, faint at first, began to grow louder. It wasn’t the lab this time—it wasn’t the device. It was something deeper, vibrating in Avery’s bones like a memory they couldn’t shake.  

A voice whispered softly from nowhere and everywhere at once.  

*“You’re almost there.”*  

Avery turned sharply, their heart pounding in their chest. “Who’s there?”  

The void rippled, a faint shimmer breaking the darkness in front of them. Slowly, shapes began to form—a table, a chair, the faint outline of walls and screens glowing faintly. The emptiness receded, and Avery realized they were no longer floating.  

They were back in the lab.  

The lab… but not quite.  

The edges of the room flickered and glitched, the floor stretching and distorting like a broken image on a corrupted screen. The device sat on the table, but its shape pulsed, shifting ever so slightly—as though it couldn’t decide what it was supposed to be.  

*“Welcome back, Avery.”*  

The voice came from behind them, calm and unnervingly familiar.  

Avery turned slowly, dread pooling in their stomach. Standing across the room was the doppelgänger—the other Avery. The reflection of themselves smiled faintly, its black, featureless eyes glinting in the flickering light.  

“Not you again,” Avery whispered, their voice shaking.  

“Me again,” the doppelgänger replied, stepping closer. “But you don’t need to fight me anymore. This time, I’m here to help.”  

Avery laughed bitterly, though it was more of a strangled sound than anything else. “Help? You call this helping? You’ve been tormenting me!”  

The doppelgänger’s smile didn’t waver. “You still don’t understand, do you?”  

“Understand what?” Avery shot back, their anger boiling over. “What the hell is happening to me? Why does everything feel… wrong?”  

The other Avery tilted its head, its expression almost sympathetic. “Because you’re not supposed to exist.”  

Avery froze, the words slicing through them like ice. “What?”  

The doppelgänger spread its arms, gesturing to the flickering lab, to the distorted walls and the pulsing device. “None of this is real, Avery. Not the lab. Not the device. Not even you.”  

Avery took a step back, their head shaking instinctively. “No. That’s not true.”  

“It is,” the reflection said softly. “You’re a fragment. A copy. A piece of a mind that was already broken.”  

“No!” Avery shouted, their voice cracking. “I remember! I remember everything. My work. Elise. Marcus. The device. I—”  

“Do you?” the doppelgänger interrupted. “Do you really?”  

The hum grew louder, vibrating through the walls as the room began to ripple again. Avery clutched their head, the pressure building behind their eyes. Images flashed across their mind in rapid succession—fractured, chaotic, impossible to hold onto.  

The lab.  

The house.  

The child’s voice.  

The faceless figure reaching through the door.  

A memory—sharp and sudden—pushed its way to the surface. Avery gasped as it hit them like a physical blow.  

---

*The device was never supposed to be used like this.*  

They had been in the lab, Elise at their side, the Corporation’s representatives watching silently from the shadows. The device hummed softly, its presence as cold and foreboding as ever. Avery remembered Marcus standing in the corner, his arms crossed, his face a mask of quiet dread.  

“What happens if it glitches?” Elise had asked, her voice steady but tinged with concern.  

Avery had looked at her, their hands poised over the console. “It won’t glitch.”  

“But what if it does?” Elise had pressed.  

Avery hadn’t answered. Instead, they had activated the device.  

For a brief moment, everything had been perfect. The memory wiped clean. The subject at peace. But then… something had gone wrong.  

The readings had spiked, the machine groaning under the strain as something *else* bled through.  

The anomaly.  

The signal.  

The thing they didn’t understand and couldn’t control.  

Avery remembered Elise shouting, Marcus pulling them away from the console as the device screamed with a sound that wasn’t mechanical at all.  

And then—  

---

Avery’s vision snapped back to the flickering lab, their breath ragged. “No,” they whispered, their voice hoarse. “I didn’t…”  

“You did,” the doppelgänger said softly. “You broke it. And when you did, it broke you.”  

Avery stumbled back, their mind spinning. “This isn’t real. This can’t be real.”  

The reflection stepped closer, its black eyes glinting. “You’re a memory, Avery. A fragment of something that’s already gone. That’s why nothing makes sense. That’s why you can’t escape.”  

“No,” Avery sobbed, collapsing to their knees. “I’m real. I have to be real.”  

The doppelgänger crouched in front of them, its voice barely above a whisper. “You don’t want to exist, Avery. Not like this. Not as a shadow of someone who’s already gone.”  

Avery looked up, tears streaming down their face. “What… what do you mean?”  

The reflection reached out, placing a hand gently on Avery’s shoulder. “You’re the glitch. The error in the system. The only way to fix it is to let go.”  

“Let go?” Avery repeated, their voice trembling.  

The lab flickered violently now, the hum rising to a deafening roar. The walls warped and twisted, the device pulsing with an unnatural light. Avery felt it—the world unraveling around them, pulling them down into the void.  

“Let go, Avery,” the doppelgänger whispered. “It’s the only way.”  

The ground cracked beneath them, darkness seeping through. Avery stared into it, their mind a whirlwind of fear and confusion.  

*Let go.*  

The doppelgänger smiled, its black eyes softening. “It’s time to stop fighting.”  

The hum reached its peak, the lab collapsing into shadow. Avery felt themselves falling—weightless, untethered—as the darkness swallowed them whole.  

And then—  

Silence.  

---

When Avery opened their eyes, they were lying on the floor of the lab. The device was still there, humming softly, its glow faint and pulsing. The console screen flickered with a single message:  

**Erase?**  

Avery stared at the words, their hands trembling as they reached for the console.  

“Yes,” they whispered.  

The screen blinked once, then twice, before the hum of the device began to rise. Avery closed their eyes, tears slipping down their cheeks as the world around them started to fade.  

For the first time in what felt like forever, Avery let go.  

---  

## **Chapter 16: Erasing the Self (Part 2)**  

The hum of the device grew louder, vibrating through the walls, through Avery’s bones, through the very fabric of their mind. The console screen flashed its single command:  

**Erase?**  

Avery’s trembling hand hovered over the button, sweat dripping from their temple as they stared at it. The word blinked rhythmically, an impossible decision pulsing in time with their heartbeat.  

“Yes,” Avery whispered again, their voice breaking.  

But the moment their fingers brushed the screen, the hum *shifted*. It wasn’t a hum anymore—it was a voice.  

*“Avery…”*  

Avery’s head snapped up, their hand jerking away as if burned. The screen distorted, the text glitching and breaking into unreadable symbols before settling again.  

**Do you remember?**  

Avery staggered back, their chest heaving. “What… what is this?”  

The room darkened, the glow from the device pulsing brighter, casting long shadows across the lab. Avery’s ears buzzed with static, and then the voice came again—soft and faint at first, like a whisper on the edge of hearing.  

*“You don’t have to do this.”*  

Avery spun around, searching the room. “Who’s there?”  

The lab flickered—just for a moment—and Avery saw something impossible. The walls rippled like water, the floor beneath them cracking open to reveal glimpses of something deeper. Shapes twisted in the shadows—figures, fragments of memory—and then they were gone, leaving Avery gasping.  

The screen flickered again:  

**You are not alone.**  

The words froze Avery in place, a chill creeping through their veins.  

“I don’t understand,” Avery whispered, their voice trembling. “What are you? What is all of this?”  

The device pulsed violently, the sound building into a crescendo before breaking into something new—something *human*. The whispers overlapped, a chorus of voices—each one familiar, each one speaking words that Avery couldn’t quite grasp.  

And then, from the shadows, a figure stepped forward.  

Avery’s breath caught in their throat.  

It was Elise.  

Her face was pale, her dark eyes hollow, but it was *her*. She stood across the room, her movements unnaturally smooth, as though the air itself carried her forward.  

“Elise?” Avery’s voice cracked. “Is that really you?”  

Elise’s head tilted slightly, her expression unreadable. “Why are you doing this, Avery?”  

“I’m trying to stop it,” Avery choked out. “The device—it’s breaking everything. I have to—”  

“Erase yourself?” Elise interrupted, her voice soft but sharp. “Do you think that’s going to fix anything?”  

Avery flinched, her words striking like a slap. “I don’t know what else to do.”  

Elise stepped closer, her form flickering like a broken projection. “This isn’t the way. You’re running from something you don’t want to face.”  

“I’m *not* running!” Avery shouted, their voice raw. “You don’t understand what it’s like. I opened the door. I let it out. It’s inside me, Elise. It’s tearing me apart.”  

Elise’s face softened, and for the briefest moment, she looked like herself again—*really* herself. “You didn’t let it out,” she said quietly. “You let it in.”  

Avery froze, her words echoing in their mind. “What?”  

Elise took another step forward, her form glitching as though reality itself struggled to hold her together. “The signal. The fractures. They’re not outside you, Avery. They’re *you*. Pieces of yourself—broken, buried, denied.”  

“No,” Avery whispered, backing away. “No, that’s not true.”  

“It is,” Elise said softly, her voice layered now—Marcus’s voice joining hers, then the child’s, then the doppelgänger’s. “You’re not erasing the device. You’re erasing yourself.”  

The room trembled violently, the walls stretching and distorting. The device’s hum swelled, the static-laden voices growing louder, drowning out everything else.  

Avery clutched their head, falling to their knees. “Stop! Please, make it stop!”  

The shadows swirled around them, the figures and fragments bleeding together. The child’s laughter. Marcus’s warnings. Elise’s voice. The faceless figure’s silent scream.  

And through it all, the device’s glow pulsed brighter and brighter.  

*“You already know.”*  

Avery opened their eyes, tears streaming down their face, as the screen blinked one final time:  

**Erase? Y/N**  

The lab faded around them. The whispers stilled. The device went silent, waiting for Avery’s answer.  

For a long moment, they just stared.  

And then, slowly, Avery reached out.  

Their hand hovered over the console, shaking.  

“What do I do?” they whispered.  

The faintest voice—soft and calm—whispered back from the void.  

*“Remember.”*  

Avery’s hand faltered, their chest tightening.  

“Remember what?” they whispered.  

The screen flashed again, and Avery saw the words—words they hadn’t seen before, words that shattered the silence.  

**You are still here.**  

Avery froze, their breath catching in their throat.  

The device pulsed one final time, and the darkness around them shattered like glass, fragments of light and shadow cascading into nothingness. Avery screamed as they fell through the void, their mind splintering into pieces.  

And then—  

Light.  

---

When Avery opened their eyes, they were lying on their back, staring up at a clear blue sky. The air was still, the world quiet.  

They sat up slowly, their body aching, their head pounding.  

They were in a field.  

The same field.  

Golden light spilled across the grass, and a soft breeze whispered through the wildflowers. Avery stared, their mind reeling. It felt… real.  

It felt *whole*.  

A voice called to them, distant and familiar.  

“Avery!”  

They turned toward the sound, their chest tightening.  

A figure stood at the edge of the field, silhouetted by the sun. They couldn’t see their face, but Avery knew who it was.  

It was themselves.  

The figure lifted a hand, waving gently. “It’s time to wake up.”  

Avery’s pulse quickened, their hands clenching the grass beneath them. “Where am I?” they whispered.  

The figure smiled faintly, their voice soft as they replied.  

“You already know.”  

The light grew brighter, swallowing everything. Avery closed their eyes as the warmth enveloped them, and for the first time in what felt like forever—  

They let go.  

---  


 
## **Chapter 17: Simulated Lives (Part 1)**  

Avery gasped as they opened their eyes, their body jolting upright as though surfacing from a deep, suffocating ocean. Their lungs burned with the first breath, the world around them blinding in its clarity.  

They weren’t in the field anymore.  

The blue sky and golden light were gone, replaced by an ordinary room—quiet, clean, and unnervingly familiar. Sunlight streamed through the window, casting soft beams across a polished wooden floor.  

Avery blinked, disoriented. Their head throbbed as they took in the surroundings: a modest living room. A couch sat near the far wall, a coffee table covered with neatly stacked books. A faint smell of coffee and fresh air lingered, warm and calming.  

Slowly, Avery pushed themselves to their feet, their limbs heavy and shaky. “Where…?”  

The word barely escaped their lips before they stopped, their heart seizing in their chest.  

A voice carried from the kitchen—a voice Avery hadn’t heard in years.  

“Morning, sleepyhead!”  

Avery froze.  

“No…” They whispered, their body trembling. “It’s not possible.”  

They turned slowly, their heart pounding, and there—standing in the doorway with a coffee mug in hand—was a woman Avery knew far too well.  

It was *her*.  

Dark hair pulled into a loose ponytail, a small scar along her chin that she’d always tried to hide, her smile warm and radiant in the morning light.  

“Lena…” Avery choked out, their voice cracking.  

Lena grinned, her brown eyes sparkling with amusement. “Well, good morning to you too,” she said teasingly. “You’re up late. I was starting to think you’d sleep through the whole day.”  

Avery stumbled back, their chest heaving. “No. You’re not real. You can’t be real.”  

Lena frowned slightly, tilting her head. “What’s gotten into you? Are you feeling okay?”  

Avery’s hands shook as they backed away, the room tilting around them. “This isn’t real. You’re not here. You—”  

*You’re gone.*  

The words lodged in Avery’s throat like broken glass. Memories surged forward—the accident, the grief, the guilt that had driven them to the device in the first place.  

But Lena was here, alive and breathing, looking at Avery with concern in her eyes. “Hey,” she said softly, setting her coffee mug down on the table. “Talk to me. What’s wrong?”  

“This is a lie,” Avery whispered, their voice barely audible. “You’re not here. You can’t be.”  

Lena stepped forward cautiously, her expression softening. “Avery, I’m right here. Look at me.”  

Avery couldn’t breathe. Their mind screamed at them to run, to reject this illusion for what it was—but their heart *ached*. They wanted to believe. They *needed* to believe.  

Lena stopped just in front of Avery, her presence warm and real in a way that Avery couldn’t comprehend. “You’ve been working too hard again, haven’t you?” she murmured, reaching out to brush Avery’s arm.  

The touch was soft, familiar. Avery’s knees nearly gave out.  

“It’s not real,” Avery sobbed, clenching their fists as tears burned in their eyes. “You’re dead. I watched you—”  

The memory struck like a hammer: Lena’s broken body, the shattered windshield, blood pooling on the pavement. Avery had held her hand as she whispered her last words.  

And now she was here. Alive. Smiling.  

Lena’s expression didn’t waver. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she said softly, her hand lingering on Avery’s arm. “I’m right here. You’re safe. We’re safe.”  

The words—so calm, so soothing—tore through Avery’s resolve like paper. “How can this be happening?” they whispered, their voice breaking.  

Lena smiled faintly, her gaze filled with a quiet sadness. “Maybe it doesn’t matter,” she said. “Maybe it’s better to stop asking.”  

Avery blinked, startled by her words. “What?”  

“Does it feel real?” Lena asked gently.  

Avery’s breath hitched. Did it? The room, Lena’s voice, her touch—it all felt so *real*. More real than anything Avery had felt in the void, in the fractured spaces where reality had broken apart.  

And yet—  

“It’s not real,” Avery said, though the conviction in their voice wavered.  

Lena’s smile faltered, just slightly. “Then why are you still here?”  

The question hit like a punch to the gut. Avery staggered back, the walls around them flickering like a glitching screen. Lena watched them, her expression still soft, but there was something else there now—something *off*.  

“Stop it,” Avery said, their voice rising. “You’re not her. This isn’t real. You’re just another simulation!”  

Lena sighed, her shoulders slumping. “Why do you always do this, Avery? Why do you keep running from what you want?”  

“I’m not running,” Avery shouted, their voice cracking. “I’m trying to stop this! To fix it!”  

Lena took another step forward, her voice steady but sharp. “You can’t fix what’s already broken.”  

The words froze Avery in place. “What?”  

“Why keep fighting?” Lena said softly, her eyes locking onto Avery’s. “Why can’t you just stay here, with me? We can be happy again. Isn’t that what you want?”  

Avery’s chest ached, the pull of her words like a weight dragging them under water. “This isn’t real,” they whispered again, tears streaming down their face.  

Lena reached out, her touch almost pleading. “It doesn’t have to be real. It just has to *feel* real.”  

The room flickered violently, the walls shaking as though the world itself were starting to come apart. Avery clutched their head, the pressure behind their eyes returning with a vengeance.  

“Stop!” they screamed. “This isn’t real!”  

The hum returned—the device’s hum—loud and consuming, vibrating through the room. Lena’s expression twisted, her smile fading as cracks began to appear along her skin.  

“Avery,” she said, her voice layered and distorted now. “Don’t do this. Don’t leave me again.”  

The walls fractured, light spilling through the cracks like a blinding flood. Lena’s form wavered, her face flickering between sadness and something cold, something *inhuman*.  

Avery fell to their knees, the world around them collapsing. “You’re not her,” they sobbed, their voice a broken whisper.  

Lena’s voice echoed one last time as the light consumed everything.  

“Why can’t you just let me stay?”  

The room shattered.  

---

Avery gasped awake, their body convulsing as they hit the cold, hard floor. They choked on air, their lungs desperate for breath.  

The lab was back—the real lab. The device hummed quietly on the table, its glow faint and steady. The console flickered, its screen blank.  

Avery curled into a ball, tears streaming down their face as they sobbed uncontrollably.  

Lena was gone.  

She had never been here.  

It wasn’t real.  

But for a moment—for just a moment—it had been.  

And that hurt more than anything else.  

---
## **Chapter 17: Simulated Lives (Part 2)**  

Avery’s sobs echoed in the empty lab, the sound ragged and hollow, swallowed by the sterile hum of the machine. Their chest heaved with the weight of it—of grief, of anger, of unbearable loneliness.  

*Why can’t you just let me stay?*  

Lena’s words haunted them, lingering in the cold air like a ghost that refused to fade. Avery wiped at their face with trembling hands, pulling themselves upright. The device pulsed quietly on the table, its glow rhythmic, steady, unrelenting.  

“Why?” Avery whispered, their voice hoarse. “Why are you doing this to me?”  

The console flickered in response, a line of distorted text appearing across the screen:  

**You already know.**  

Avery squeezed their eyes shut, their teeth grinding together. “Stop saying that!” they shouted, slamming a fist against the table. “Stop! Stop—just *tell me!*”  

The machine didn’t answer. The hum continued, soft and indifferent, as if mocking Avery’s desperation.  

They stumbled to their feet, pacing the room like a caged animal. “It’s not real,” they muttered to themselves, their voice unsteady. “None of this is real. Lena, the house… the field—it’s all lies. *It’s all lies.*”  

But even as they said it, doubt gnawed at the edges of their thoughts. The warmth of Lena’s touch. The smell of coffee. The sound of her voice, soft and familiar. For a moment, Avery had felt… safe. Whole.  

And wasn’t that what they wanted?  

They stopped pacing, their eyes falling on the device. Its glow pulsed faintly, like a heartbeat, as though waiting for them to make a decision.  

*It doesn’t have to be real. It just has to feel real.*  

Lena’s words surfaced again, and Avery clenched their fists, their knuckles white. “No,” they whispered, shaking their head. “No. I won’t let you win.”  

The shadows in the corners of the lab seemed to ripple as if reacting to Avery’s defiance. The air grew heavier, pressing down on their chest, and the hum of the machine deepened, vibrating in their bones.  

Then, faintly, Avery heard it.  

A voice.  

*“Avery.”*  

They froze, their blood running cold. It wasn’t Lena’s voice this time—it was deeper, distorted, layered with something *else*.  

“Avery,” the voice repeated, louder now, filling the room. “You can’t keep running.”  

Avery spun around, searching the lab, but it was empty. “Who’s there?” they demanded, their voice shaking. “Show yourself!”  

The console screen blinked to life, text crawling across it like something alive:  

**You let it in. Now it’s time to see.**  

The lights in the lab flickered violently, the shadows stretching and distorting. Avery stumbled back, their head pounding as static hissed in their ears. The hum of the machine grew deafening, the sound twisting into a low, guttural roar.  

“No,” Avery gasped, clutching their head. “Not again. Not again!”  

The walls rippled, and the room around them began to *melt*. The floor warped beneath their feet, the ceiling stretching into darkness. Shapes formed in the shadows—half-seen figures, faces twisted in anguish, reaching hands clawing at the edges of Avery’s vision.  

They staggered back, pressing themselves against the table as the room collapsed around them. “Stop!” they screamed. “Leave me alone!”  

The roar peaked, and the shadows surged forward—consuming the lab, the device, everything. Avery squeezed their eyes shut as the darkness swallowed them whole, the pressure in their skull building until they thought they might shatter.  

And then—  

Silence.  

---

When Avery opened their eyes, they were somewhere new.  

They stood in a long hallway, its walls cracked and peeling, the air heavy with dust and decay. The floor creaked beneath their feet as they stepped forward, the sound echoing eerily in the silence.  

Avery’s pulse quickened as they glanced around. It was familiar—too familiar.  

“This can’t be happening,” they whispered.  

At the far end of the hallway was a door. A door they knew. A door they remembered.  

The door from the house.  

“No,” Avery said, their voice trembling. “I’m not going back there.”  

But even as they said it, their feet moved forward, drawn toward the door like a moth to a flame. The hallway stretched on forever, the door always just out of reach. Shadows pooled along the edges of the walls, shifting like something alive.  

A voice whispered faintly behind them, soft and mocking.  

*“Why are you still fighting?”*  

Avery ignored it, their breathing shallow as they forced themselves to keep walking.  

*“You don’t have to do this. Just stop, Avery. Let go.”*  

The voice was Lena’s this time, clear and soothing, and Avery’s steps faltered. They turned sharply, their heart pounding.  

Lena stood in the middle of the hallway, her figure glowing faintly in the dim light. Her face was calm, her expression gentle.  

“Come back,” she said softly. “You don’t have to keep hurting yourself like this.”  

Avery shook their head, their voice cracking. “You’re not real. You’re not her.”  

Lena’s smile wavered, the light around her flickering. “Does that matter?” she whispered. “What’s real doesn’t have to hurt. You could be happy here, Avery. With me.”  

Avery clenched their fists, tears stinging their eyes. “Stop it!”  

“You’re breaking yourself apart,” Lena said, her voice growing distant, layered with static. “Why keep running?”  

The shadows surged from the walls, crawling toward Avery like dark tendrils. The hallway trembled violently, the floor cracking and splintering beneath their feet.  

“Stop!” Avery screamed, stumbling back. “Get away from me!”  

Lena’s figure shattered like glass, her voice echoing as the shadows swallowed everything.  

*“Why won’t you let me stay?”*  

The floor gave way beneath Avery, and they fell into darkness.  

---

Avery hit the ground hard, the impact jarring through their body. Gasping, they pushed themselves upright, their vision blurred and disoriented.  

They were back in the lab again—or at least, what *looked* like the lab. The walls flickered in and out of focus, pieces of the room missing, replaced by empty voids.  

The console screen glowed faintly in the darkness, a single message waiting for them.  

**Who are you?**  

Avery stared at the words, their chest tightening as the question repeated in their mind like a drumbeat.  

*Who are you?*  

They didn’t know anymore.  

Their memories felt fractured, incomplete—reality slipping further from their grasp with every passing moment.  

Avery sank to the floor, their head in their hands. “Who am I?” they whispered, tears streaming down their face.  

The shadows lingered at the edges of the room, watching, waiting.  

And from the darkness, the voice came again.  

*“Remember.”*

## **Chapter 18: The Ghost in the Machine (Part 1)**  

Avery sat curled on the floor of the flickering lab, their body shaking, their breath coming in ragged gasps. The console glowed faintly in the fractured darkness, its words burning into their mind:  

**Who are you?**  

They couldn’t answer. They didn’t know. Every memory they reached for dissolved like smoke in their hands, leaving them with nothing but fragments—faces, voices, moments that no longer fit together.  

*You let it in.*  

The voice echoed in the void, a whisper that sent icy tendrils crawling across Avery’s skin. “Stop,” they whispered, their voice hoarse. “Please stop.”  

The shadows in the room stirred, shifting like living smoke. The walls rippled, the hum of the machine deepening into a low, resonant growl that vibrated through Avery’s bones.  

And then—  

*“Why are you still here?”*  

Avery froze. The voice was different this time—familiar, soft, and unmistakably *their own*.  

They lifted their head slowly, their gaze falling on the far side of the room. Through the haze of glitching shadows, a figure stepped into view.  

It was Avery.  

The doppelgänger stood there, its black, featureless eyes glinting faintly in the fractured light. It smiled, a slow and unnerving curve of its lips.  

“You don’t belong here,” the doppelgänger said softly, its voice layered and distorted, yet undeniably Avery’s.  

Avery scrambled back, pressing themselves against the cold floor. “What are you?” they whispered.  

The doppelgänger tilted its head, its gaze unblinking. “I’m you,” it replied. “Or what’s left of you.”  

Avery shook their head, tears burning in their eyes. “No. You’re a lie. A glitch.”  

The other Avery took a step closer, the shadows curling around its feet like ink. “A glitch?” It laughed, the sound hollow and strange. “Is that what you tell yourself? That this isn’t real? That *I’m* not real?”  

“You’re not!” Avery shouted, their voice cracking. “You’re just a piece of the signal—a trick!”  

The doppelgänger stopped, its smile fading. “No, Avery. I’m what you refuse to see. I’m the truth you’re hiding from.”  

Avery flinched, their mind spinning. “What truth?”  

The figure crouched, staring at Avery with those black, endless eyes. “You let it in, remember? The signal. The machine. You built it, and you let it rewrite you.”  

“No,” Avery whispered, shaking their head violently. “I didn’t mean to—I didn’t know!”  

“But you did,” the doppelgänger said, its voice calm and patient, as though speaking to a child. “And now you’re here, trapped in the ruins of your own mind.”  

Avery stared at the figure, their breath shallow. “This… this isn’t my mind. This is the lab. This is the device—”  

The room flickered violently, the walls glitching like a corrupted screen. The doppelgänger spread its arms, gesturing to the crumbling space around them. “What lab? Look around you, Avery. This place isn’t real. It’s *you.*”  

The words struck like a knife, and Avery’s vision swam. They clutched their head, the pressure building again, the hum of the machine louder now—louder and deeper, like it was resonating with something inside of them.  

“No,” Avery whispered. “No, no, no.”  

“You can’t fight it anymore,” the figure said softly, stepping closer. “It’s already inside you. It’s *become* you. You’re just a ghost, Avery. A shadow of what you were.”  

Avery’s stomach twisted violently, bile rising in their throat. “Stop. Just stop.”  

The doppelgänger crouched lower, its face inches from Avery’s, its voice a whisper. “Why keep running? Why not let it end?”  

The hum crescendoed, drowning out everything else, the walls cracking and collapsing into darkness. Avery screamed, the sound ripped from their chest as the figure reached out, its black eyes swallowing them whole—  

And then—  

Silence.  

---

Avery woke up lying on a cold, metallic floor. The hum was gone, replaced by dead, empty stillness. They pushed themselves upright, their movements sluggish and painful, their limbs heavy as stone.  

The room around them was vast and dark, stretching into shadows in every direction. Lines of faint light glowed along the floor, tracing intricate patterns like circuits spreading infinitely outward.  

Avery staggered to their feet, blinking through the haze clouding their vision. “Where… where am I?”  

The answer came not as a voice but as a feeling—an awareness seeping into their mind like ink spreading through water.  

They were inside the machine.  

The realization hit Avery like a physical blow. They turned in a slow circle, the emptiness pressing in on all sides, suffocating and infinite. “No,” they whispered, their voice echoing in the void. “No, this isn’t real. This isn’t *real.*”  

The lines of light on the floor pulsed faintly, and as Avery watched, they began to shift—rearranging into words that stretched across the vast, dark space.  

**YOU ARE HERE.**  

Avery stumbled back, their heart pounding in their chest. “Stop this!” they screamed into the void. “Let me out!”  

The lines shifted again, faster this time, forming a new message:  

**YOU LET ME IN.**  

The shadows around them stirred, the darkness thickening like a living thing. Avery’s mind raced as they backed away, their breath coming in short, panicked gasps.  

A voice echoed through the void—deep, mechanical, and layered with countless whispers.  

*“You are me now, Avery.”*  

“No!” Avery shouted, clutching their head as the sound reverberated inside their skull. “You’re lying!”  

The lights pulsed brighter, spreading outward in ripples, as the voice whispered again.  

*“You can’t erase me. I’m already inside you.”*  

The ground beneath Avery shifted, the metallic surface warping and cracking as though something massive were pushing up from below. Avery staggered, falling to their knees, the pressure in their head building to unbearable levels.  

“Stop!” they screamed. “Get out of my head!”  

But the voice only laughed, low and resonant, echoing endlessly in the dark.  

*“You can’t escape yourself, Avery.”*  

The lights blazed, blinding, and Avery’s world shattered once more into darkness.  

---
## **Chapter 18: The Ghost in the Machine (Part 2)**  

When the darkness receded, Avery was on their knees, their hands pressed against the cold, metallic surface beneath them. Their head throbbed with pain, and their body felt like it had been hollowed out, the weight of everything unbearable.  

The endless void stretched before them, silent now, the glowing circuits carved into the floor pulsing faintly like a heartbeat. Avery forced themselves to look up, the lines of light swirling and shifting, rearranging into words.  

**YOU CAN’T ERASE ME.**  

The message burned into Avery’s mind, as though the machine—no, the *signal*—had carved it there.  

“You’re wrong,” Avery whispered, their voice hoarse and shaking. “I can stop you. I can—”  

The words on the ground flickered, shifting again, faster this time.  

**YOU ARE ME. I AM YOU.**  

“No!” Avery screamed, forcing themselves to their feet. “You’re not me! You’re just a glitch—a mistake!”  

The void rippled in response, the shadows deepening at the edges of the space, like something alive, something vast. A low hum began to rise again, vibrating through Avery’s bones.  

“Where are you?” Avery demanded, spinning in a slow circle. “Show yourself!”  

The hum grew louder, and then—  

A voice.  

*“You still don’t understand, do you?”*  

Avery’s breath caught in their chest. The voice was their own, yet deeper, distorted, layered with static. It was *everywhere*, pressing down on them like a weight they couldn’t escape.  

The circuits on the floor flared brighter, and from the swirling light, a figure began to emerge. It stepped forward slowly, its form coalescing from the void like it had been there all along.  

It was Avery.  

Not the glitching doppelgänger, not the shadowy form. This version was different—perfectly clear, perfectly composed. Every detail was sharp: the curve of their jaw, the line of their shoulders, the way their dark eyes reflected the light.  

But something was wrong.  

The other Avery’s expression was calm, serene even, but their eyes were empty. Black. Void.  

“You’re not me,” Avery said, their voice trembling.  

The other Avery smiled faintly, tilting their head. “Aren’t I?”  

“I don’t know what you are,” Avery shot back, taking a shaky step backward, “but you’re not me. You can’t be.”  

The figure stepped closer, its movements unnervingly smooth, as though it weren’t bound by the laws of reality. “I’m everything you’ve tried to forget,” it said softly. “Everything you buried. Everything you refused to face.”  

Avery shook their head violently, their heart pounding in their chest. “That’s not true.”  

The other Avery gestured to the endless void around them, its black eyes unblinking. “Look around you. This place—it’s all you. Every shadow. Every glitch. Every crack in reality. You created this when you let me in.”  

“I didn’t let you in!” Avery shouted, their voice breaking. “I didn’t know what the signal would do!”  

The figure stopped a few feet away, their gaze locking onto Avery’s. “You knew,” it said softly. “You *always* knew.”  

The words hit Avery like a physical blow. Their legs gave out, and they fell to their knees, their breath coming in shallow, ragged gasps.  

Memories surged forward—images that had been buried, hidden, denied. The first activation of the device. The anomaly in the readings. Elise’s warnings. Marcus’s anger. The way Avery had looked at the data and told themselves it didn’t matter.  

*It was fine.*  

*It would work.*  

The voice of the machine whispered in the back of their mind, echoing like a drumbeat.  

*You already knew.*  

Avery clutched their head, shaking uncontrollably. “No. No, I didn’t mean to—I didn’t know it would *break* everything!”  

The other Avery crouched down in front of them, their voice soft and patient, like a parent explaining something to a child. “You can’t hide anymore. You built the machine. You gave the signal life. And when you realized what it was—what it could do—you let it in.”  

Avery looked up slowly, tears streaming down their face. “Why?” they whispered. “Why me?”  

The figure smiled faintly. “Because you were broken long before the machine. The signal didn’t create this place, Avery. It only gave form to what was already inside you.”  

Avery froze, their mind reeling. “What are you saying?”  

The other Avery’s black eyes seemed to deepen, drawing Avery in, swallowing everything else. “You were trying to escape yourself. The guilt. The loss. The *truth*. You wanted to forget, so you built the perfect tool to erase it all. But instead of erasing the pain…”  

The void around them trembled, the shadows rippling like waves.  

“…you erased yourself.”  

The realization slammed into Avery like a freight train, leaving them gasping, broken. They remembered it all now—the late nights in the lab, the moments of doubt they had ignored, the small fractures in their mind they had dismissed as exhaustion.  

And then Lena.  

The accident.  

The unbearable grief.  

The machine had been their answer—their escape. They had poured everything into building it, convincing themselves it would help others, that it would erase pain, erase suffering.  

But deep down, they had built it to erase *themselves*.  

Avery sank forward, their forehead pressing against the cold ground. The void was alive now, the shadows curling around them like vines. The hum of the machine grew louder, vibrating through their body, through their mind.  

The other Avery stood, their voice calm and final. “This is what you wanted, isn’t it? To disappear. To stop existing. To let go.”  

Avery’s hands trembled against the floor. “I didn’t… I didn’t know…”  

The figure’s black eyes stared down at them, unfeeling. “But you know now.”  

The ground beneath Avery cracked, the void splitting open into endless darkness. The hum reached a deafening roar, and the shadows surged forward, pulling at Avery’s body, dragging them down into the abyss.  

“You can still let go,” the other Avery whispered. “It’s not too late.”  

Avery closed their eyes, the darkness swallowing them whole.  

And somewhere, faintly, a voice echoed in their mind—  

*“Remember.”*  

---

  
 


## **Chapter 19: The Loop Tightens (Part 1)**  

Avery’s eyes snapped open to darkness.  

At first, there was nothing—no sound, no light, no sensation beyond the thundering of their heartbeat. Slowly, they became aware of the floor beneath them, cold and smooth, the faint vibrations of the machine humming just out of reach.  

*Still here.*  

Avery pushed themselves upright, their body heavy, every movement an effort. The void around them stretched endlessly, unbroken except for a faint pulse of light glowing in the distance. It pulsed like a heartbeat—steady, relentless.  

“What is this?” Avery whispered, their voice hoarse and small.  

The pulse answered, spreading out in ripples across the ground like waves on water. The hum rose with it, vibrating through Avery’s bones, through the very fabric of the space around them.  

The familiar voice spoke again, soft and hollow, echoing through the darkness.  

*“Welcome back.”*  

Avery froze, dread curling in their stomach. They turned slowly, and there—emerging from the void—was the other Avery. Their doppelgänger, perfect and still, the black void of their eyes reflecting the faint light.  

“You again,” Avery muttered, their voice cracking. “Why won’t you leave me alone?”  

The reflection tilted its head, its expression calm and detached. “Why would I leave? You brought me here.”  

“I didn’t bring you anywhere,” Avery spat, their hands clenching into fists. “You’re the glitch. You’re not real.”  

The doppelgänger smiled faintly, the corners of their mouth curling upward in a way that made Avery’s skin crawl. “A glitch? Is that what you tell yourself? That everything wrong with you is just a mistake?”  

“Stop,” Avery said, taking a shaky step backward. “You don’t know anything about me.”  

The void trembled, the ground beneath Avery’s feet shuddering as though alive. The pulse of light quickened, growing brighter, and with it came flashes of images—brief, fractured glimpses of memories.  

*The lab. The device humming to life.*  
*Elise shouting, her face contorted in panic.*  
*Marcus’s eyes, cold and distant.*  
*Lena’s smile, fading into blood-stained glass.*  

Avery staggered, clutching their head as the memories surged, relentless and sharp. “Stop it!”  

The doppelgänger stepped forward, their black eyes locking onto Avery’s. “Why are you still fighting this?” they asked softly. “Why are you running from the truth?”  

“I’m not running,” Avery gasped, their vision swimming. “I’m trying to fix it.”  

“Fix it?” The doppelgänger’s smile widened, their voice sharp with amusement. “You think you can *fix* this? Fix yourself?”  

The pulse of light quickened again, the hum rising into a low roar that filled Avery’s ears, drowning out every other thought. The images returned, faster this time—each one a stab of pain as it burned through Avery’s mind.  

*The first time they activated the machine. The spike in the readings.*  
*The warning messages on the console, ignored.*  
*The anomaly—pulsing, spreading, alive.*  

“You let it in,” the doppelgänger said, their voice low and accusing. “You built the machine to erase the parts of yourself you couldn’t bear to face. But it didn’t erase them, Avery. It broke them. It broke *you.*”  

Avery fell to their knees, their hands pressed to their temples as the pressure in their head became unbearable. “No!” they shouted, tears streaming down their face. “I didn’t mean to—I didn’t know!”  

“But you did,” the doppelgänger whispered, crouching in front of Avery. “You knew the risks. You ignored the warnings. And now you’re trapped here, in the ruins of your own creation.”  

The void pulsed again, brighter this time, and the ground beneath Avery cracked like glass. The fragments shimmered, reflecting distorted images of Avery’s face—each one twisted, fractured, broken.  

“I can’t…” Avery sobbed, their voice breaking. “I can’t keep doing this.”  

The doppelgänger leaned closer, their black eyes unblinking. “Then let go,” they said softly. “Stop fighting. Stop running. It’s time to accept what you are.”  

Avery lifted their head, their tear-streaked face illuminated by the light radiating from the fractures in the ground. “And what am I?” they whispered.  

The doppelgänger smiled faintly, the shadows swirling around them. “A ghost,” they replied. “A shadow of the person you used to be. The machine didn’t erase the parts you wanted to forget—it scattered them, leaving you hollow and incomplete. You don’t exist anymore, Avery. Not really.”  

The words sent a fresh wave of despair crashing over Avery. They looked down at their hands, their breath catching in their throat as the skin shimmered—*glitched*—fading in and out like static.  

“No,” Avery whispered, staring at the fragments of themselves. “No, I’m still here. I’m still—”  

“You’re not,” the doppelgänger interrupted, their voice cold and final. “You’re a loop, Avery. A broken record, repeating the same mistakes, over and over again. You’ll never escape this. You *are* this.”  

The hum reached a deafening peak, the void around Avery trembling violently. Cracks spread outward from the ground, the light spilling through like liquid fire, consuming everything it touched.  

Avery screamed, their voice raw and desperate. “I don’t want this! I don’t want to disappear!”  

The doppelgänger straightened, their form flickering like a mirage. “Then stop running,” they said, their voice barely audible above the roar. “Accept it. Accept *me.*”  

The cracks widened, and the void shattered. Avery felt themselves falling, weightless, as the light swallowed them whole.  

---

When Avery’s eyes opened again, they were somewhere new.  

They lay sprawled on the floor of the lab—or what was left of it. The room was warped and twisted, the walls glitching in and out of focus. The console flickered weakly, its glow dim and erratic, like it was on the verge of shutting down.  

The hum of the machine was faint now, a low vibration in the air, as though the entire system were collapsing under its own weight.  

Avery pushed themselves upright, their movements sluggish and unsteady. Their body felt… wrong. Lighter. More *fragile.*  

They looked down at their hands.  

Their skin flickered—transparent in places, their fingers glitching at the edges like corrupted data.  

“No,” Avery whispered, panic rising in their chest. “No, no, no…”  

The console screen blinked to life, a single message appearing in the fractured light:  

**LOOP ERROR DETECTED.**  
**MEMORY INTEGRITY: 12%.**  

Avery stared at the words, their mind spinning. “Memory integrity?” they murmured. “What does that—”  

The screen glitched violently, the text shifting before settling into something new:  

**YOU ARE UNSTABLE.**  

Avery staggered back, their heart pounding. The lab trembled around them, the walls warping as though the space itself were disintegrating.  

“Help me,” Avery whispered, their voice breaking. “Somebody… help me.”  

But there was no answer.  

The hum of the machine deepened, the console’s glow flaring brightly before beginning to fade. The shadows crept closer from the edges of the lab, twisting and stretching like fingers reaching for Avery.  

And as they watched, the screen flickered one last time, the final message burning itself into their mind:  

**THE LOOP CANNOT BE BROKEN.**  

Avery sank to the floor, their body trembling as the darkness closed in around them.  

“No,” they whispered, tears streaming down their face. “No, please… I don’t want to disappear…”  

The shadows swallowed the room, and the hum of the machine faded into silence.  

And then—  

Nothing.  

---

## **Chapter 19: The Loop Tightens (Part 2)**  

Nothing.  

The void stretched endlessly in all directions—no sound, no light, no sensation. Avery floated in the emptiness, untethered, their thoughts echoing in the cavernous silence.  

*The loop cannot be broken.*  

The words reverberated in their mind like a curse, each repetition sinking deeper, pulling them down into the dark.  

*Is this it?*  

Avery didn’t know if they were speaking, thinking, or imagining the question. They were no longer sure if their body existed at all. The sensation of being *real*—of touch, of breath—had slipped away, replaced by weightlessness and stillness.  

Time didn’t exist here. Avery didn’t exist here.  

And yet—  

A flicker.  

A pulse, faint and distant, like a heartbeat on the edge of hearing.  

Avery’s eyes—if they still had eyes—snapped open. The void rippled, the darkness shifting like water disturbed by a stone. For the first time, something *moved*.  

The pulse came again, stronger this time, and with it, a thread of light—thin and faint—cutting through the black. Avery focused on it, their fragmented thoughts clinging to the light as though it might save them.  

*Follow it.*  

The whisper was small, almost lost in the silence, but it was there—a voice, their voice. Something within them *moved*, a flicker of will buried beneath layers of despair.  

With effort, Avery pushed forward—or maybe they were pulled. The light widened, spreading in ripples through the void, and with it came sound—soft at first, like static, then clearer. A hum.  

The hum of the device.  

“No,” Avery whispered, their voice raw and trembling. “I can’t go back.”  

The light pulsed in response, growing brighter, sharper. Shapes began to form, fractured images bleeding into focus. Avery saw glimpses of the lab: the table, the console, the device itself. It was like watching the pieces of a broken mirror drift together, each shard snapping into place.  

*The loop cannot be broken.*  

The words flashed across Avery’s mind, sharp and cruel, but the light pulled them forward anyway.  

Suddenly, a voice rang out—distorted, layered, and all too familiar.  

*“Why are you still fighting?”*  

Avery froze, the light faltering as the voice filled the space around them. From the darkness, something emerged.  

The doppelgänger.  

It stepped forward, perfectly calm, its black eyes shining like empty voids. Its presence pulled the light inward, the glow dimming as shadows crawled closer.  

“You’re wasting time, Avery,” the doppelgänger said softly. “This is where it ends.”  

Avery shook their head, teeth gritted. “No. I don’t believe you.”  

The doppelgänger tilted its head, its expression almost pitying. “Believe what you want. It doesn’t change anything. You’re a part of this now. You *are* the machine.”  

“I’m not!” Avery shouted, their voice cracking. “I’m still here. I’m still *me!*”  

The void trembled, the thin light flaring as though it heard Avery’s words. The doppelgänger frowned, its form flickering slightly. “You can’t change this. You’ve seen the truth. You’re broken, Avery—beyond repair.”  

Avery staggered back as the shadows surged closer, the edges of their form dissolving into static. Their limbs felt heavy again, their body glitching, fading.  

“Maybe I am broken,” Avery whispered, their voice trembling. “Maybe I made mistakes. But that doesn’t mean I stop fighting.”  

The doppelgänger’s face twisted into something darker, its voice hardening. “There is no escape. No way out. You’ll only break yourself further.”  

Avery clenched their fists, a spark of defiance flaring in their chest. “Then I’ll break. But I won’t let you win.”  

The light behind them pulsed violently, pushing the shadows back as though feeding on Avery’s resolve. The doppelgänger recoiled slightly, its black eyes narrowing.  

“You’re only prolonging the inevitable,” it hissed.  

“Maybe,” Avery shot back, turning toward the growing light. “But you don’t control me. Not anymore.”  

They pushed forward, toward the light, as the void trembled violently. The shadows clawed at them, tearing at the edges of their mind, but Avery forced themselves to move, their entire being focused on that single thread of light.  

The doppelgänger’s voice rose into a roar, the calm veneer finally cracking. “You can’t escape! *You are me!*”  

“No,” Avery whispered, their voice steady now, their path clear. “I’m more than you.”  

The light swelled, blinding and warm, consuming the darkness. Avery felt the shadows recoil, the hum of the machine growing louder, closer, until it was everywhere—inside them, around them, guiding them forward.  

They stepped into the light.  

---

When Avery’s eyes opened, they were back in the lab.  

The walls were intact, the shadows gone. The device sat on the table, its glow faint but steady, as though it had been waiting for them. The console flickered, the screen blank and waiting.  

Avery pushed themselves upright, their body trembling but whole. For the first time, the hum of the machine didn’t sound threatening. It sounded… calm. Steady.  

They staggered toward the console, the faint glow illuminating their face. The screen blinked to life, and for a long moment, nothing happened.  

Then, slowly, a single line of text appeared.  

**Who are you?**  

Avery stared at the question, their chest tightening. They remembered seeing those words before, when the machine had tried to break them—to erase them.  

But now, something was different.  

Avery’s hands hovered over the console, their fingers shaking. The answer came not as a thought, but as a feeling—something real, something solid.  

“I’m Avery,” they whispered, their voice soft but steady. “And I’m still here.”  

The text on the screen flickered once, then cleared.  

The hum of the machine quieted, its glow dimming until it was little more than a whisper. Avery stepped back, their shoulders sagging as exhaustion pulled at them, but for the first time in what felt like forever, they felt *real*.  

The machine didn’t fight back. The walls didn’t tremble.  

The loop was silent.  

Avery turned toward the lab door, their steps unsteady but resolute. Beyond it, they didn’t know what waited—but they knew one thing: they weren’t running anymore.  

They pushed the door open, stepping into the light.  

And for the first time, they walked forward.  

---



## **Chapter 20: Breaking Point (Part 1)**  

The light was blinding at first—cold and sterile—like the dawn after a long, endless night. Avery stumbled through the doorway, their legs unsteady, their mind still buzzing with the echoes of the machine’s hum.  

The lab door shut behind them with a low *thud*, leaving only silence.  

Avery squinted, shielding their eyes as they took in their surroundings. It wasn’t the lab anymore. It wasn’t the void. They stood in a corridor—familiar yet strange—its white walls stretching infinitely in either direction. The lights overhead buzzed faintly, and the air smelled of antiseptic and metal.  

“Where am I now?” Avery whispered to themselves, their voice small and trembling.  

Their footsteps echoed as they moved forward, the corridor narrowing ever so slightly with each step, the walls pressing closer. Avery reached out, their fingertips brushing the cold, smooth surface—too smooth. Like it wasn’t real.  

A door appeared at the end of the hallway, a single gray rectangle embedded in the wall. It had no handle, no window—just a faint, pulsing glow at its center. Avery’s stomach twisted as they approached it, dread pooling deep in their chest.  

“Another trick,” they muttered, their teeth clenched. “It’s just another trick.”  

But when they reached the door, it slid open with a soft hiss. The glow intensified, spilling into the hallway like liquid light, forcing Avery to squint. They hesitated, the warmth brushing against their skin, inviting and unnatural all at once.  

*“You already know.”*  

The whisper came from nowhere and everywhere, twisting in Avery’s mind like a knife.  

“No,” Avery growled, their fists clenched. “I’m not playing your games anymore.”  

They stepped through the doorway, bracing themselves for whatever lay on the other side.  

---

The room beyond was vast, impossibly large, its ceiling lost in shadow. Monitors stretched across the far wall, each screen flickering with fragmented images—Avery’s memories. The lab. Elise. Marcus. The child’s laughter. Lena’s smile.  

It was all there, fractured and looping, scenes playing over and over like a broken reel of film.  

At the center of the room stood the machine.  

The MERI Device.  

It sat on a raised platform, humming softly, its polished surface gleaming in the cold light. Its presence filled the room—*alive*, watchful—as though it had been waiting for Avery all along.  

Avery’s breath caught as they stepped closer, their heart pounding in their chest. “This is it,” they whispered. “This is where it started.”  

And where it would end.  

“Why did you bring me back here?” Avery shouted, their voice echoing through the cavernous room. “What do you want from me?”  

The screens flickered, their images distorting, and the hum of the machine deepened—almost like it was responding. The ground trembled faintly beneath Avery’s feet as shadows pooled along the edges of the room.  

From the darkness, a figure emerged.  

The doppelgänger.  

It stepped forward slowly, its black eyes fixed on Avery, its form perfectly still except for the faint ripple along its edges—like a projection struggling to hold its shape.  

“You made it,” the figure said softly, its voice layered and hollow.  

Avery’s fists tightened. “You again,” they spat. “What do you want from me?”  

The doppelgänger smiled faintly, tilting its head. “I don’t want anything, Avery. *You’re* the one who keeps coming back. You’re the one who can’t let go.”  

“I didn’t choose this!” Avery shot back, their voice shaking with fury. “I didn’t choose *any* of this!”  

The figure’s smile faded. “Didn’t you?”  

The screens on the walls pulsed brighter, their images shifting to one single moment—Avery at the console, their hands trembling over the controls as they activated the device for the first time. Elise and Marcus in the background, their faces a blur of concern and fear.  

The doppelgänger gestured toward the screens. “You built the machine. You turned it on. You ignored the warnings. All of this—every fracture, every shadow, every loop—is your creation.”  

Avery stumbled back, shaking their head violently. “No. I didn’t know what it would do.”  

“You knew enough,” the doppelgänger said sharply, their voice darkening. “You told yourself it was for the greater good. You told yourself it would help people. But it was never about them, was it?”  

Avery froze, their breath caught in their chest. “What are you talking about?”  

The doppelgänger stepped closer, their black eyes burning. “It was always about you. About your pain. Your guilt. You wanted to forget, Avery. You wanted to erase *yourself.*”  

“No,” Avery whispered, tears pooling in their eyes. “That’s not true.”  

The room trembled, the hum of the machine rising like a storm. The doppelgänger’s voice echoed, filling the space, each word a dagger.  

“You built the perfect trap. A machine that could erase memories, rewrite reality—and now you’re stuck inside it, running from the truth. *Running from yourself.*”  

Avery sank to their knees, their body shaking as the words tore through them. The screens flashed images faster now, scenes blurring together—Lena’s smile, Lena’s death, the device humming to life, the void swallowing them whole.  

“You let me in,” the doppelgänger whispered, crouching before Avery. “And now I’m all that’s left.”  

The machine’s hum grew deafening, vibrating through Avery’s bones as the room flickered and glitched. The ground cracked beneath them, threads of light spilling through the fractures, pulling the space apart.  

Avery clutched their head, sobbing. “I didn’t mean to. I didn’t—”  

“But you did,” the figure said softly, its voice calm now, final. “You can’t run from it anymore, Avery. You have to choose.”  

The ground split open, and the machine blazed with light, its hum a roar that filled every corner of the room. Avery looked up, their tear-streaked face illuminated by the glow.  

“Choose what?” they gasped.  

The doppelgänger smiled faintly, its form starting to dissolve into the light. “To let go… or to stay trapped.”  

The room shuddered violently, the cracks widening, the light blinding as it swallowed everything. Avery screamed as the ground fell away, the hum of the machine rising into a crescendo—  

And then—  

Silence.  

---

Avery opened their eyes.  

They were back in the lab.  

The device sat before them, silent and polished, as though it had never been touched. The console screen glowed faintly, waiting.  

Avery stared at it, their breath trembling. They reached out with shaking hands, their fingers hovering over the controls.  

*Choose.*  

The hum of the machine lingered softly, a whisper now, waiting for their answer.  

“Let go,” Avery murmured to themselves, their voice unsteady.  

They stared at the screen, their reflection staring back at them.  

And slowly, they made their choice.  

---
## **Chapter 20: Breaking Point (Part 2)**  

The hum of the machine grew louder, pressing into Avery’s skull like invisible fingers. The faint glow of the console illuminated their pale face, their reflection flickering in the glassy surface.  

*Choose.*  

The doppelgänger’s voice echoed in Avery’s mind, soft but unrelenting. *To let go… or to stay trapped.*  

Avery’s hand trembled as it hovered over the console. “What happens if I let go?” they whispered, though they already knew there would be no answer.  

The lab was silent, waiting.  

Avery staggered back, their breath ragged as they turned to look around the room. The walls flickered faintly, cracks spiderwebbing through the edges of reality, the same light bleeding through that Avery had seen in the void. It was all coming apart now, fraying like the edge of a tattered rope.  

And they were at its center.  

Their mind was splitting—each fragment trying to pull them in a different direction.  

Stay. Let go. Choose.  

“This isn’t real,” Avery muttered, their voice raw, as though trying to remind themselves. “None of this is real.”  

But was it?  

The thought slithered into their mind like a shadow, spreading doubt. It felt real—the hum, the ache, the weight of the choice before them. Every fragment, every memory, every voice—they were all real in the ways that mattered.  

And wasn’t that the point?  

“Is this who I am now?” Avery whispered to the empty lab, their voice trembling. “A loop? A glitch?”  

The machine didn’t respond, but the hum deepened, vibrating through the floor like the thrum of a heartbeat.  

Avery turned back toward the console, staring at the faint glow of the screen. A single line of text appeared, pulsing softly, waiting for their answer:  

**ERASE? Y/N**  

Avery let out a broken sob, their hand hovering closer. “I don’t want this anymore.”  

The walls around them shuddered, cracks widening as the light pulsed brighter. The lab seemed to respond to Avery’s despair, the edges of the room warping, distorting.  

“You built this,” a voice said softly.  

Avery froze, their head snapping toward the far corner of the room.  

The doppelgänger stood there, bathed in the fractured light. It was almost fully formed now, every detail of Avery’s face perfectly mirrored except for those black, hollow eyes that reflected nothing.  

“You created the machine,” it continued, its voice layered with static. “You built it to erase yourself.”  

“I didn’t mean to,” Avery choked out. “I thought it would help. I thought it would—”  

“Fix you?” the figure interrupted, stepping closer. “Erase the pain? The guilt?”  

Avery’s shoulders sagged, the weight of the truth pressing down on them like a stone. “I didn’t know what I was doing.”  

The doppelgänger’s expression softened—almost pitying, almost human. “But you did, Avery. You knew it wouldn’t fix anything. You were only running from yourself. And now…”  

It gestured toward the machine, its hum rising in pitch, filling the room. “…you’ve reached the end.”  

The end.  

Avery looked back at the console, tears streaming down their face. The screen’s glow pulsed in time with their heartbeat.  

“Erase,” Avery whispered, the word almost inaudible.  

The doppelgänger tilted its head. “Is that what you want?”  

Avery stared at the console, their vision blurred with tears. “I don’t know anymore.”  

Silence hung between them, thick and suffocating.  

And then the doppelgänger spoke again, its voice soft and gentle. “You can’t erase yourself, Avery. You’re still here, no matter how much you try to disappear.”  

The words struck something deep inside Avery, a raw nerve they’d been trying to bury. They turned to face the figure, their voice barely a whisper. “Then what do I do?”  

The doppelgänger smiled faintly, a sad, knowing smile. “You remember.”  

The hum of the machine grew deafening, shaking the room, the cracks spreading until the light threatened to consume everything. Avery staggered back, clutching their head as images—*memories*—flooded their mind in a torrent.  

Lena’s laughter.  
The accident.  
The lab, the warnings ignored.  
The device humming to life for the first time.  
The child in the hallway.  
The shadows.  
The void.  

It all came together, each fragment snapping into place like pieces of a puzzle. Avery fell to their knees, gasping for breath as the weight of it all hit them.  

“I remember,” they sobbed. “I remember everything.”  

The doppelgänger knelt in front of them, its black eyes calm, steady. “Then you know what you have to do.”  

Avery looked up, their tear-streaked face illuminated by the light flooding through the cracks. “What happens if I let go?”  

The doppelgänger smiled faintly. “You’ll find out.”  

The room shuddered violently, the machine’s hum rising into a roar as the console screen flickered, its message flashing one final time:  

**ERASE? Y/N**  

Avery took a deep, shuddering breath. Their hand trembled as they reached for the console, their fingers brushing the keys.  

“I won’t disappear,” they whispered, the words more for themselves than for the machine.  

They pressed the button.  

The hum reached a deafening peak, the light consuming everything. Avery closed their eyes, letting it wash over them, through them, until there was nothing left but silence—  

And the faintest whisper of a voice.  

*“You’re still here.”*  

---

When Avery opened their eyes, they were lying in a field bathed in golden light. The air was warm, the scent of wildflowers drifting on a gentle breeze.  

Slowly, they pushed themselves upright, blinking at the impossible beauty of the world around them.  

It was the field.  

The same field.  

But something was different this time. The edges of the world were clear, sharp. The warmth on their skin felt real. The hum of the machine was gone.  

A figure stood at the edge of the field, watching them.  

It was Avery.  

Not the doppelgänger. Not the shadow. Just *them*—whole and unbroken, their dark eyes reflecting the sunlight.  

“Who are you?” Avery whispered, their voice steady, clear.  

The figure smiled gently. “You already know.”  

The wind carried the words across the field, and for the first time, Avery didn’t flinch. They stood, brushing the dirt from their hands, and turned toward the horizon where the sun hung low and golden.  

And they began to walk forward.  

This time, they weren’t afraid.

### **Act V: The Fractured Truth** 

## **Chapter 21: The Final Confrontation (Part 1)**  

Avery stepped into the next room, their breath catching as they took in the scene before them.  

It was a perfect replica of the lab, but something about it felt wrong—off in a way they couldn’t quite articulate. The walls gleamed too brightly, the floor was spotless, and every piece of equipment sat in its designated place, untouched by time. It was the lab as it had once been, before the fractures, before the glitches.  

And yet, Avery could feel the underlying tension in the air, as if the room itself were holding its breath.  

At the center of the lab, the device stood on its platform, humming faintly. It looked the same as always—sleek, polished, and unassuming—but Avery knew better now. They could feel its presence, pulsing like a living thing, aware of their every step.  

“You’re almost there.”  

The voice startled Avery, making them spin around.  

Marcus stood near the far wall, his arms crossed over his chest, his expression grim. He looked tired—more worn than Avery had ever seen him. His eyes, usually sharp and calculating, held a strange mix of sadness and resolve.  

“Marcus,” Avery breathed, their voice laced with both relief and suspicion.  

He nodded slowly. “It’s good to see you,” he said, though his tone was guarded.  

Avery took a cautious step forward. “What is this? Why are you here?”  

Marcus’s gaze flicked to the device, then back to Avery. “This is the end,” he said simply. “The final choice.”  

Avery’s stomach twisted. “What choice?”  

“To stop it,” Marcus replied. “To end this cycle once and for all.”  

Avery frowned, their heart pounding in their chest. “You’ve been working with the Corporation this whole time. You knew what the device was capable of. Why would you want to stop it now?”  

Marcus’s jaw tightened, and he let out a heavy sigh. “I didn’t know what it would become,” he admitted. “Not at first. I thought… I thought we were building something that could help people. Something that could fix the broken pieces of their lives.”  

“But?” Avery pressed, their voice sharper now.  

“But it wasn’t about helping people,” Marcus said bitterly. “It was about control. Power. The Corporation wanted to weaponize the device—use it to erase dissent, rewrite entire populations.” He shook his head. “And by the time I realized what we’d done, it was too late. The signal was already loose.”  

Avery stared at him, a mix of anger and disbelief swirling inside them. “You could’ve stopped this,” they said, their voice trembling. “You should’ve told me the truth!”  

“I tried,” Marcus snapped, his tone defensive. “But you wouldn’t listen. You were so wrapped up in your own guilt, your own need to prove yourself, that you didn’t see what was happening.”  

Avery flinched, the words cutting deeper than they wanted to admit. “So what now?” they asked, their voice quieter. “Why are you here?”  

“To give you a chance,” Marcus said, his expression softening. “A chance to fix this. To destroy the device and end the signal for good.”  

Avery’s gaze shifted to the device, its faint hum resonating in their chest. “Destroy it?” they echoed.  

Marcus nodded. “It’s the only way. As long as the device exists, the signal will spread. It’ll keep fracturing reality, pulling you—and everyone else—deeper into the loop.”  

Avery’s hands clenched into fists at their sides. “You’re asking me to destroy the only thing I’ve ever built,” they said, their voice shaking. “The only thing I’ve ever…”  

“...cared about?” Marcus finished, raising an eyebrow. “Or the only thing that ever gave you purpose?”  

Avery glared at him, their anger flaring. “This isn’t about me.”  

“Isn’t it?” Marcus countered, stepping closer. “Everything about this—about the device, the signal, the fractures—it’s all tied to you, Avery. You created this. You let it in.”  

Avery’s chest tightened, the weight of Marcus’s words pressing down on them. “I didn’t mean for this to happen,” they whispered, tears welling in their eyes.  

“I know,” Marcus said, his voice softening again. “But you’re the only one who can stop it now.”  

The air in the room grew heavier, the hum of the device deepening. Avery could feel its pull, like it was reaching for them, drawing them closer. The screens along the walls flickered, images flashing in rapid succession—memories, moments, fragments of their life.  

Lena’s laughter. Elise’s warnings. The void. The field.  

“What if I can’t do it?” Avery asked, their voice barely audible.  

Marcus stepped aside, gesturing to the device. “You don’t have a choice,” he said.  

Avery stared at the machine, their heart pounding in their chest. The hum seemed to grow louder, resonating through the room, through their very being.  

And then, from behind them, another voice spoke.  

“You don’t have to do this.”  

Avery turned sharply, their breath catching in their throat.  

Elise stood near the doorway, her face pale and haunted, her eyes filled with a quiet desperation. She looked at Avery, her expression pleading.  

“There’s another way,” Elise said, stepping forward.  

Marcus’s expression darkened, and he turned to her sharply. “Don’t,” he warned.  

Elise ignored him, her focus entirely on Avery. “You don’t have to destroy the device,” she said. “You can contain it. Control it.”  

“That’s not possible,” Marcus snapped, his tone harsh. “The signal is too far gone. The only way to stop it is to destroy the source.”  

“You don’t know that,” Elise shot back, her voice firm. She turned to Avery, her gaze softening. “You built this, Avery. You understand it better than anyone. If anyone can control it, it’s you.”  

Avery’s head spun, the weight of their choice pressing down on them like a crushing tide. “I don’t…” they stammered, their voice breaking. “I don’t know what to do.”  

The hum of the device grew louder, almost deafening now, as if urging Avery to make a decision.  

Marcus stepped forward, his eyes locking onto Avery’s. “Destroy it,” he said firmly. “End this once and for all.”  

Elise moved closer, her voice softer but no less insistent. “Save it,” she said. “You can fix this, Avery. You can fix everything.”  

The room seemed to close in around them, the light from the device growing brighter, casting long shadows across the walls. Avery felt the pull of the machine, its presence wrapping around them like a vice.  

Their hands trembled at their sides, their mind racing.  

One choice.  

One moment.  

Avery took a deep breath, their eyes closing as the hum of the device resonated in their chest.  

And then—  

They made their decision.  

---
## **Chapter 21: The Final Confrontation (Part 2)**  

Avery’s breath came in shallow gasps, their hands trembling as they stood between Marcus and Elise. The weight of the decision pressed down on them, suffocating, relentless. The device hummed louder, as if it were alive, as if it were waiting for them to act.  

“Think about what you’re saying,” Marcus snapped, glaring at Elise. His voice was sharp, cold. “We’ve been through this. Containment is impossible. The signal can’t be controlled—it’ll spread, like it always does. Destroy the device, Avery. It’s the only way.”  

Elise stepped forward, her face calm but her tone unwavering. “No, Marcus. Destroying the device will only erase everything—everything Avery has fought to hold onto. This isn’t just about stopping the signal. It’s about understanding it. About *fixing* what’s been broken.”  

Avery looked between them, their vision blurring with tears. Their mind raced, fragmented thoughts crashing into one another like waves.  

“What if neither of you is right?” Avery whispered, their voice shaking.  

Marcus clenched his jaw, his fists tightening at his sides. “You don’t have the luxury of doubt, Avery. This thing has consumed everything—it’s consumed *you*. If you hesitate now, it’ll all come undone.”  

Elise softened her gaze, her voice gentle but insistent. “It doesn’t have to end in destruction. You created the device. You understand the signal better than anyone. You can take control, Avery. You can stop the loop without erasing yourself.”  

“I don’t even know if that’s possible!” Avery snapped, the frustration bubbling over. “How do I know I won’t make it worse?”  

“You don’t,” Elise admitted, her voice steady. “But you know yourself, Avery. You’re more than the fractures, more than the pain. You’ve been fighting to hold on to something real—don’t give up now.”  

Marcus scoffed, shaking his head. “Don’t listen to her,” he growled. “This isn’t about saving yourself. It’s about saving *everyone else*. Do you really want more people to go through this? To be trapped in this nightmare like you have been?”  

Avery’s hands clenched into fists. “What if you’re wrong, Marcus? What if destroying it doesn’t fix anything?”  

“Then at least it’s over!” Marcus shouted, his voice filled with fury and desperation. “At least it doesn’t keep spreading, keep destroying everything it touches. You want to gamble with the lives of everyone else because you’re afraid to let go?”  

Avery flinched, Marcus’s words cutting deep.  

But then Elise stepped closer, her tone calm but unyielding. “He’s trying to scare you,” she said quietly. “But you know the truth, Avery. You’ve seen it. The signal isn’t just destruction—it’s possibility. A chance to rebuild, to make things right. If you destroy the device, you’ll never know what could’ve been.”  

The room trembled, the cracks along the walls spreading further, the light from the device growing brighter. The hum deepened, vibrating through Avery’s chest like a second heartbeat.  

“You’re running out of time,” Marcus said, his voice low but urgent.  

“Please, Avery,” Elise added, her eyes locking onto theirs. “Trust yourself. Trust what you’ve created.”  

Avery took a shaky breath, their gaze flicking between Marcus, Elise, and the device. The weight of the moment was unbearable, their mind a whirlwind of fear, doubt, and regret.  

They closed their eyes, the hum of the device resonating in their thoughts, in their very soul. And for a moment, they let it all fall away—the voices, the arguments, the memories.  

All that remained was the choice.  

---

When Avery opened their eyes, they stepped forward.  

Marcus tensed, his expression unreadable. “What are you doing?”  

Elise held her breath, her hands clasped tightly in front of her. “Avery…”  

Avery didn’t respond. They climbed onto the platform, standing before the device. Its surface gleamed under the fractured light, its hum vibrating through their fingertips as they reached out to touch it.  

The console screen flickered, displaying a single line of text:  

**COMMAND?**  

Avery’s reflection stared back at them, their face pale, their eyes haunted but resolute.  

“I’m sorry,” they whispered—to Marcus, to Elise, to themselves.  

And then they entered their decision.  

---

The device roared to life, its hum rising into a deafening crescendo as the room filled with blinding light. Avery staggered back, shielding their eyes, their heart pounding in their chest.  

“Avery!” Elise shouted, her voice barely audible over the chaos.  

Marcus’s voice followed, sharp and panicked. “What did you do?!”  

Avery couldn’t answer. The light consumed everything, pulling them under, tearing through their mind with the force of a hurricane.  

And then—  

Silence.  

---

Avery awoke in darkness.  

For a moment, they thought they were back in the void, back in the endless nothingness that had haunted them for so long. But then they felt it—the warmth of sunlight on their skin, the soft rustle of grass beneath their fingertips.  

They opened their eyes, blinking against the golden light that spilled across the horizon.  

They were in the field again.  

But this time, it was different. The edges of the world were clear, sharp. The air was warm, the sky impossibly blue. It felt real in a way it never had before.  

Avery sat up slowly, their body aching but whole. The hum of the machine was gone, replaced by the gentle sound of the wind and the distant song of birds.  

They turned, their breath catching in their throat.  

Elise stood a few feet away, her face calm but unreadable. Marcus was there too, his arms crossed over his chest, his expression tight with suppressed emotion.  

And beyond them, in the distance, Avery saw themselves.  

The doppelgänger stood at the edge of the field, its black eyes shining faintly in the sunlight. It didn’t move, didn’t speak—it simply watched.  

Avery took a deep breath, their heart steady. For the first time, they felt no fear.  

They stood, brushing the grass from their hands, and turned to face Elise and Marcus.  

“It’s over,” Avery said softly.  

Elise’s expression softened, a small, hopeful smile tugging at her lips.  

Marcus frowned, his gaze lingering on the distant figure of the doppelgänger. “Is it?” he asked quietly.  

Avery followed his gaze, their eyes locking with the reflection of themselves.  

“It doesn’t matter,” they said after a moment. “Because I’m still here.”  

The doppelgänger tilted its head, as if acknowledging the words. Then, slowly, it turned and walked away, disappearing into the horizon.  

Avery exhaled, the tension in their chest easing for the first time in what felt like forever.  

The field stretched endlessly before them, golden and inviting, and for the first time, they felt ready to move forward.  

Together, they began to walk toward the light.  

---



## **Chapter 22: The Ultimate Betrayal (Part 1)**  

The golden field stretched endlessly, the horizon bathed in light that seemed to pulse gently with each step Avery took. The warm breeze brushed against their skin, carrying the faint scent of wildflowers. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, the hum of the machine was gone—no static, no fractures, no shadows clawing at the edges of their vision.  

And yet, Avery couldn’t shake the unease coiling deep in their chest.  

Elise walked beside them, her expression calm but her eyes darting toward Avery every so often, as if she were measuring their state of mind. Behind them, Marcus trailed a few steps back, his silence heavy and brooding. Avery could feel the weight of his gaze pressing into their back, but he said nothing.  

“You did it,” Elise said finally, breaking the quiet. Her voice was soft, tentative. “You stopped the device. The signal… it’s gone.”  

Avery didn’t answer right away. Their eyes scanned the horizon, searching for any sign of the cracks, the glitches, the shadows that had haunted them for so long. But there was nothing—only the endless field and the clear, unwavering sky.  

“It doesn’t feel over,” Avery murmured, their voice distant.  

Elise hesitated, her brows furrowing. “What do you mean? The loop is broken. You saw it yourself—the signal collapsed when you made your choice.”  

Avery stopped walking, their hands clenching into fists at their sides. “Then why does it still feel like I’m trapped?”  

Elise turned to face them fully, her expression flickering between concern and something Avery couldn’t quite place. “You’re not trapped,” she said firmly. “This is real, Avery. You’re free.”  

Behind them, Marcus let out a sharp breath, his voice cutting through the fragile quiet. “Are they?”  

Elise shot him a warning look. “Don’t start, Marcus.”  

He ignored her, stepping forward until he was standing a few feet away from Avery. His arms were crossed over his chest, his jaw tight with barely contained frustration. “You think this is freedom?” he said, his tone low but sharp. “You think this—” he gestured to the field, to the horizon “—is real?”  

Avery’s stomach twisted, their pulse quickening. “What are you talking about?”  

Marcus’s dark eyes locked onto Avery’s, unflinching. “You didn’t stop the device,” he said bluntly. “You didn’t destroy it. You just rewrote the loop. A prettier version, maybe, but it’s still a loop. You’re still trapped.”  

“That’s not true,” Elise snapped, her voice rising. She stepped between Avery and Marcus, her posture defensive. “You’re lying. The signal collapsed—Avery broke the loop!”  

“Did they?” Marcus countered, his voice steady but laced with something dangerous. “Or did they just reset it?”  

Avery’s mind raced, the doubt creeping back in like a shadow. “I… I chose to stop it,” they said, their voice trembling. “I shut it down.”  

Marcus’s gaze softened slightly, but there was no relief in his expression. “Did you?” he asked quietly. “Or did the device give you exactly what it wanted you to see?”  

Elise whirled around to face Avery, her hands gripping their shoulders. “Don’t listen to him,” she said urgently. “He’s trying to manipulate you. He’s always been against you, Avery—don’t you see that?”  

Avery stared at her, their breath catching. “What are you talking about?”  

“Elise,” Marcus warned, his tone low. “Don’t.”  

But Elise ignored him, her grip on Avery tightening. “He’s been working with the Corporation from the start,” she said, her voice trembling with barely suppressed anger. “He didn’t come back to help you—he came back to make sure the device stayed under their control.”  

“That’s a lie,” Marcus snapped, his calm demeanor cracking. “You don’t know what you’re talking about.”  

“I know enough,” Elise shot back, her eyes blazing. “I know you’ve been feeding them information, sabotaging every chance Avery had to fix this.”  

Avery’s head spun, the world tilting beneath their feet. “Is that true?” they whispered, their voice barely audible.  

Marcus’s jaw tightened, and for a moment, he didn’t answer.  

“That’s not the point,” he said finally, his voice low.  

“It *is* the point!” Elise shouted, stepping closer to him, her body trembling with rage. “You’ve been lying to us this entire time—using Avery to clean up your mess!”  

Avery staggered back, their mind reeling. “Why?” they demanded, their voice rising. “Why would you do this?”  

Marcus exhaled sharply, his gaze shifting to the ground. “Because the device can’t be destroyed,” he said quietly. “Not completely. The Corporation knows that. They’ve known it from the start.”  

Elise froze, her eyes widening. “What are you talking about?”  

Marcus looked up, his expression grim. “The signal isn’t just some anomaly, some glitch. It’s alive. It’s adaptive. Every time you try to destroy it, it learns. It rebuilds itself. The only way to contain it is to keep it under control—to trap it in a loop it can’t escape.”  

Avery’s chest tightened, the weight of his words suffocating. “And that’s what you’ve been doing?”  

Marcus nodded slowly. “I didn’t have a choice. If the Corporation got their hands on it, they’d use it to rewrite everything—memories, identities, entire lives. I couldn’t let that happen.”  

“So you used me,” Avery said, their voice trembling with anger. “You used me to fix your mistakes.”  

Marcus’s face hardened. “I was trying to protect you.”  

“By lying to me?” Avery shouted, their voice cracking. “By keeping me trapped in this—this *prison*?”  

“I kept you alive!” Marcus snapped, his voice rising for the first time. “You think breaking the loop would’ve saved you? It would’ve torn you apart! The signal would’ve consumed you, erased everything that makes you *you*.”  

Avery staggered back, their body trembling. They turned to Elise, their eyes pleading. “Is that true?”  

Elise hesitated, her lips pressing into a thin line.  

“It doesn’t matter,” she said finally, her voice quiet but firm. “What matters is that you have a choice now, Avery. You don’t have to stay in the loop. You can take control. Rewrite it on your terms.”  

“And what happens if I do?” Avery asked, their voice raw.  

Elise glanced at Marcus, her expression hardening. “You’ll finally be free.”  

Marcus scoffed, shaking his head. “Free to do what?” he muttered. “To destroy everything we’ve worked for? To unleash the signal again? You’re asking them to gamble with their life—and everyone else’s—for some illusion of freedom.”  

“It’s not an illusion,” Elise shot back, her voice sharp. “It’s hope.”  

The field trembled faintly, the light on the horizon dimming as the tension between them grew. The shadows at the edges of the world began to stir, creeping closer.  

Avery stood frozen between them, their mind racing, their heart pounding.  

One of them was lying.  

The other was telling the truth.  

But which one?

## **Chapter 22: The Ultimate Betrayal (Part 2)**  

The silence that followed was deafening. Avery’s breath came in sharp gasps, their chest tight as the weight of the decision pressed down on them. The golden light of the field dimmed further, the edges of the world fraying, cracks spiderwebbing into the horizon.  

Avery turned to Elise, then to Marcus, their heart pounding as they searched for answers in their faces. Both looked back at them with unwavering intensity—two opposing forces, each claiming to hold the truth.  

“How am I supposed to trust either of you?” Avery asked, their voice trembling. “You’ve both lied to me.”  

“I haven’t lied,” Marcus said sharply, stepping forward. “I’ve done what I had to do. You might not like it, but I’ve always told you the truth when it mattered.”  

Elise scoffed, her eyes narrowing. “That’s rich, coming from the man who’s been working with the Corporation this whole time.”  

“I was *fighting* them,” Marcus shot back, his voice rising. “I sabotaged their plans at every turn! You think this was easy? That I wanted to use Avery? I didn’t have a choice!”  

“You always have a choice,” Elise said coldly.  

Avery’s head snapped toward her. “And what about you?” they demanded, their voice breaking. “You’ve been pushing me to take control, to ‘rewrite the loop.’ But you never told me what that actually means. What aren’t you telling me, Elise?”  

Elise hesitated, her mouth opening and closing as she struggled for an answer.  

“Elise,” Avery pressed, their tone sharper now. “Tell me the truth.”  

Elise sighed, her shoulders slumping. “Rewriting the loop means merging with the signal,” she admitted quietly. “It’s the only way to contain it, to stop it from spreading. You’d have control, Avery—but it would change you. Permanently.”  

Marcus let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. “There it is,” he said. “She wasn’t going to tell you that part, was she?”  

“I was going to tell them when they were ready!” Elise snapped, her voice trembling with frustration. “It’s not an easy choice to make, Marcus. I didn’t want to force them into it!”  

“But you *were* going to force them,” Marcus said, his tone accusing. “You just wanted them to trust you first.”  

Elise glared at him, but she didn’t deny it.  

Avery stepped back, their hands shaking. “So those are my choices?” they said, their voice hollow. “Destroy the device and risk losing everything, or merge with the signal and lose myself?”  

Elise’s expression softened, and she reached out toward Avery, though she stopped short of touching them. “You wouldn’t lose yourself,” she said gently. “You’d still be you—just… more. You’d have control over the signal. You could fix the fractures, stop the loop from ever starting again.”  

Marcus shook his head, his eyes dark. “Don’t listen to her. The signal doesn’t work like that. It’s not something you can control—it’s alive, Avery. It’ll consume you, twist you into something unrecognizable. You’ll think you’re in control, but you won’t be. You’ll just be another piece of it.”  

Elise turned on him, fury blazing in her eyes. “You don’t know that!” she shouted. “You don’t know what Avery is capable of—what they can do! You’re just afraid, Marcus. Afraid that they might succeed where you failed.”  

Marcus’s jaw tightened, and for a moment, he said nothing. Then he turned to Avery, his voice quieter but no less firm. “I’m not afraid for me,” he said. “I’m afraid for you. I’ve seen what the signal does to people—what it’s already done to you. If you merge with it, there won’t be anything left of who you are. You’ll disappear, Avery. Just like the others.”  

Avery’s breath hitched, their mind spinning. “The others?”  

Marcus hesitated, glancing at Elise, then back at Avery. “You’re not the first, Avery,” he said grimly. “The Corporation ran experiments—tested the device on people before you. They all tried to merge with the signal, to control it. And every single one of them failed.”  

Avery’s stomach twisted, a cold knot forming in their chest. “Why didn’t you tell me this before?”  

“Because I thought you could be different,” Marcus said, his voice tinged with regret. “But now I’m not so sure.”  

Avery turned to Elise, their eyes wide with desperation. “Is that true?” they asked, their voice barely above a whisper. “Did they all fail?”  

Elise hesitated, her gaze dropping to the ground. “Yes,” she admitted quietly. “But they didn’t have what you have, Avery. They weren’t connected to the signal like you are. They weren’t its creator.”  

“That doesn’t mean it’ll work,” Marcus snapped.  

“It means Avery has a chance,” Elise shot back.  

The cracks in the field widened, light spilling through as the world trembled around them. The shadows at the edges of the horizon crept closer, their movements slow but deliberate, like predators closing in on their prey.  

Avery looked between Marcus and Elise, their heart pounding in their chest. Both of them believed they were right. Both of them wanted Avery to trust them.  

But only one of them could be telling the whole truth.  

“Why do I feel like this is still the loop?” Avery asked suddenly, their voice rising. “Why does it still feel like I’m trapped?”  

Marcus stepped forward, his expression grim. “Because you are,” he said. “As long as the device exists, the loop will keep pulling you back. Destroy it, Avery. It’s the only way to break free.”  

Elise shook her head, her eyes pleading. “You can end the loop without destroying yourself,” she said. “You can rewrite it, reshape it into something better. But you have to trust yourself, Avery. You have to believe that you’re strong enough to handle this.”  

The cracks spread further, the ground beneath Avery’s feet shaking violently. The shadows surged forward, their forms twisting and writhing, and the light from the horizon began to flicker.  

Avery’s hands clenched into fists at their sides, their mind racing. They couldn’t trust Marcus. They couldn’t trust Elise.  

But they had to make a choice.  

“I…” Avery’s voice cracked, their body trembling.  

The device’s hum grew louder, resonating in their chest, urging them forward. The shadows crept closer, their tendrils reaching for Avery, pulling them toward the edge.  

“I can’t…” Avery whispered, tears streaming down their face.  

“Choose,” the doppelgänger’s voice echoed from somewhere in the shadows. “It’s the only way out.”  

Avery closed their eyes, their heart pounding.  

And then they made their decision.  

---




## **Chapter 23: The Truth Unveiled (Part 1)**  

Avery opened their eyes.  

The world around them was still trembling, the cracks spreading wider as light and shadow battled for dominance. The air hummed with the energy of the device, vibrating through their very core. Marcus and Elise stood frozen, their gazes locked on Avery, both waiting—waiting for the choice that would decide everything.  

“I’ve made my decision,” Avery said, their voice steady but low.  

Elise took a step forward, her expression hopeful, desperate. “Avery, you’re doing the right thing. You can save this. You can save *yourself*.”  

Marcus frowned, his arms crossed tightly over his chest. “If you think merging with the signal is going to fix this, you’re wrong. You don’t know what it’s going to do to you.”  

“I don’t know what either of you wants from me anymore,” Avery shot back, their frustration spilling over. “You’ve both been lying to me, manipulating me—using me. But this is my choice now. Not yours.”  

The room—or the field, or whatever fractured reality they were standing in—shuddered violently. The cracks spread beneath their feet, threatening to consume everything. Shadows licked at the edges of the horizon, creeping closer with every second, while blinding light poured through the fractures, illuminating the faces of Marcus and Elise.  

“Then make it,” Marcus said, his voice low and sharp. “But don’t say I didn’t warn you when it all falls apart.”  

Elise opened her mouth to speak, but Avery silenced her with a raised hand. “Enough. I’ve heard enough from both of you.”  

The hum of the device grew louder, a low, resonant sound that seemed to fill the space around them. Avery turned toward it, their heart pounding as they stepped closer. The polished surface of the machine glowed faintly, its presence overwhelming.  

The console screen flickered, and a single word appeared:  

**CHOOSE.**  

Avery hesitated, their hands trembling at their sides. The words of Marcus and Elise echoed in their mind, battling for control of their thoughts. Destroy the device, or merge with the signal. End it all, or risk losing themselves completely.  

But was there another way?  

The thought came unbidden, sharp and insistent. Avery stared at the machine, their reflection staring back at them from its polished surface.  

For a moment, they saw the doppelgänger in the reflection—its black eyes, its cruel smile.  

“You can’t escape me,” it whispered, its voice layered and distorted. “I’m part of you. I always have been.”  

Avery clenched their fists, their chest tight. “You’re wrong,” they said through gritted teeth.  

The doppelgänger’s reflection tilted its head, its smile widening. “Am I? You’ve been running in circles, trying to fix something you don’t even understand. You think you’re different, but you’re not. You’re just another piece of the loop.”  

“I’m not like you,” Avery whispered, their voice trembling.  

The doppelgänger leaned closer in the reflection, its black eyes burning into Avery’s. “Aren’t you?”  

The reflection flickered, and suddenly it wasn’t the doppelgänger anymore. It was Lena.  

Avery staggered back, their breath catching in their throat. “No,” they whispered, shaking their head. “You’re not real.”  

Lena’s reflection smiled faintly, her eyes soft but sad. “Does it matter?” she asked gently. “You’ve been searching for answers, Avery. Searching for meaning. But what if there isn’t any?”  

Avery’s legs felt weak, their heart pounding in their chest. “I… I just wanted to fix things,” they said, their voice breaking. “I wanted to make it right.”  

Lena’s reflection tilted her head. “And what would that even look like? A world without pain? Without regret? Without *you*?”  

The hum of the machine grew louder, the ground trembling beneath Avery’s feet. They turned away from the reflection, their mind racing.  

“Is there even a way out of this?” they whispered to themselves.  

The console screen flickered again, its message changing:  

**TRUTH OR OBLIVION?**  

Avery stared at the words, their hands shaking. “Truth?” they murmured. “What truth?”  

From behind them, Marcus’s voice broke through the tension. “It doesn’t matter what the truth is,” he said. “What matters is survival. Destroy the device, Avery. End this before it consumes you.”  

“Don’t listen to him,” Elise countered, her voice firm. “You’ve come this far because you wanted answers. Don’t turn back now. You deserve to know the truth.”  

The world around them shuddered violently, the cracks widening as the light and shadows surged toward each other, colliding in bursts of raw energy. The machine pulsed in time with the chaos, its hum rising into a deafening roar.  

Avery closed their eyes, their body trembling. They could feel the pull of the machine, the weight of their choices pressing down on them.  

Truth or oblivion.  

Control or destruction.  

They opened their eyes, their gaze locking onto the console. Slowly, they stepped forward, their reflection staring back at them. This time, it was just their own face—tired, broken, but determined.  

“I choose…” Avery whispered.  

They placed their hands on the console, the screen glowing brighter beneath their touch. The machine roared to life, its hum filling the space around them, drowning out the voices of Marcus and Elise. The light consumed everything, pulling Avery under, tearing through their mind with the force of a hurricane.  

And then—  

They saw it.  

The truth.  

---

Images flooded Avery’s mind in rapid succession—fractured, chaotic, but slowly coalescing into something clear.  

They saw themselves in the lab, activating the device for the first time. They saw the anomaly—the signal—emerging from the machine like a living thing, wrapping itself around them, seeping into their mind.  

They saw Lena, her face twisted in fear, her voice trembling as she begged Avery to stop.  

They saw Marcus, his face grim, his hands clenched into fists as he turned away.  

They saw Elise, watching silently, her expression unreadable.  

And then they saw the Corporation. The shadowy figures in suits, watching from behind glass walls as the signal spread, consuming everything it touched.  

The signal wasn’t just a glitch, Avery realized. It wasn’t a mistake. It was designed this way.  

The device hadn’t malfunctioned. It had done exactly what it was supposed to do—erase memories, rewrite reality, reshape the world in the image of those who controlled it.  

But something had gone wrong. The signal had escaped, breaking free of its constraints, becoming something new. Something alive.  

And Avery was at the center of it.  

*You let it in.*  

The words echoed in their mind, sharp and accusing.  

Avery gasped, their eyes snapping open. The light faded, and they found themselves back in the field, the golden horizon stretching endlessly before them.  

Elise and Marcus stood nearby, watching them with wary eyes.  

“What did you see?” Elise asked softly.  

Avery didn’t answer right away. Their hands trembled as they looked down at the ground, their mind reeling.  

“I saw the truth,” they said finally, their voice hollow.  

“And?” Marcus pressed, his tone urgent.  

Avery looked up, their gaze locking onto his.  

“The signal isn’t just alive,” they said. “It’s… me. It’s us. It’s everything we’ve tried to bury, everything we’ve tried to erase. And now it’s too big to contain.”  

Elise’s face paled, and Marcus took a step back, his expression darkening.  

“What does that mean?” Elise asked, her voice barely above a whisper.  

Avery closed their eyes, the hum of the machine still echoing faintly in their mind.  

“It means we’ve already lost,” they said.  

---
## **Chapter 23: The Truth Unveiled (Part 2)**  

The air grew heavy, dense with the weight of Avery’s words. The horizon flickered, the cracks in the field widening as light and shadow warred for dominance. Marcus and Elise stood frozen, their faces pale, their eyes fixed on Avery.  

“What do you mean, ‘we’ve already lost?’” Elise asked, her voice trembling.  

Avery looked at her, their expression hollow. “The signal isn’t just some anomaly we can shut down. It’s us. It’s everything we’ve ever tried to erase, everything we’ve buried, suppressed, rewritten.” They gestured toward the cracks in the field, the light bleeding into the dark. “It’s all coming apart because we’ve tried to control something we were never meant to control.”  

Marcus’s jaw tightened, his fists clenched at his sides. “No,” he said sharply. “That’s not true. The signal isn’t some… reflection of us. It’s a virus. A weapon. It’s *not alive*—it’s a malfunction we created. And it can be destroyed.”  

Avery shook their head, their voice steady but distant. “You don’t understand. The device wasn’t just erasing memories. It was rewriting them—rewriting reality. Every time we used it, we weren’t just erasing the past. We were creating something new, something incomplete.”  

Elise took a shaky step forward, her eyes wide. “And the signal?” she asked softly.  

“The signal is everything we erased,” Avery replied, their voice cracking. “Everything we didn’t want to face. It’s all still there—fractured, broken, but alive. And now it’s fighting to put itself back together.”  

Elise covered her mouth, her eyes brimming with tears. “Oh my God,” she whispered.  

Marcus shook his head violently, his voice rising. “No. This is just another trick. The signal is manipulating you, Avery. It’s trying to make you doubt yourself, to stop you from doing what needs to be done.”  

“What needs to be done?” Avery shot back, their voice filled with anger. “Destroying the device? Destroying the signal? Do you really think that’ll fix anything?”  

Marcus stepped closer, his expression hard and unrelenting. “It’ll stop it from spreading. It’ll give us a chance to rebuild, to move forward.”  

“Move forward into what?” Avery demanded, their voice trembling. “Another loop? Another fracture? The signal isn’t just out there, Marcus—it’s in us. It’s *me*. If you destroy the device, it won’t stop. It’ll just scatter again, grow stronger, and the cycle will start all over.”  

Marcus’s eyes narrowed, his tone cold. “So what, then? You just give up? Let it consume everything?”  

Avery shook their head, tears streaming down their face. “I don’t know,” they admitted, their voice breaking. “I don’t know how to fix this.”  

The field trembled violently, the ground beneath their feet splitting open as the cracks spread further. The shadows surged forward, twisting and writhing, while the light from the horizon dimmed, its warmth fading.  

Elise stepped closer to Avery, her voice soft but firm. “You said the signal is alive—that it’s us. If that’s true, then there has to be a way to work with it. To understand it.”  

Marcus let out a sharp, bitter laugh. “Understand it? You can’t reason with a virus, Elise. The signal doesn’t care about us—it’s not sentient. It’s chaos, pure and simple.”  

“Maybe that’s what you want to believe,” Elise shot back, her eyes blazing. “But if the signal is everything we’ve erased, then maybe it’s trying to tell us something. Maybe it’s not chaos—it’s truth.”  

Avery looked between them, their mind spinning. “And what if the truth is too much for us to handle?”  

Elise turned to them, her expression softening. “Maybe it is,” she said quietly. “But you deserve to know it. Don’t you?”  

The shadows crept closer, their tendrils reaching for Avery, pulling at the edges of their mind. The hum of the machine grew louder, a deafening roar that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere all at once.  

Marcus stepped forward, his voice harsh. “Avery, listen to me. Destroy the device. It’s the only way to stop this. If you don’t, the signal will consume you—it’ll consume *everything.*”  

Elise moved to Avery’s other side, her voice urgent but calm. “You don’t have to destroy it. You can rewrite it. You can take control, guide the signal to something better. You can fix this, Avery. But you have to trust yourself.”  

The field shuddered, the cracks widening into chasms. Light and shadow bled together, their collision sending waves of energy rippling through the air. Avery clutched their head, their thoughts fracturing under the weight of it all.  

“I can’t…” they whispered, their voice trembling. “I can’t do this.”  

“Yes, you can,” Elise said, her tone firm but kind.  

“No,” Marcus snapped, his voice cutting through the chaos. “You can’t save this, Avery. You know that. End it now, before it’s too late.”  

Avery fell to their knees, their chest heaving as tears streamed down their face. The machine’s hum grew louder, the shadows closing in, the light fading into darkness.  

And then—  

A voice.  

*“Remember.”*  

Avery froze, their breath catching in their throat. The voice was soft, faint, but unmistakable.  

Lena.  

They looked up, their gaze snapping to the horizon. Through the cracks, they saw her—standing in the distance, her silhouette framed by the fading light.  

“Lena?” Avery whispered, their voice trembling.  

Elise and Marcus turned, their expressions filled with confusion. “What is it?” Elise asked.  

Avery didn’t answer. They pushed themselves to their feet, their legs shaking as they stumbled toward the figure.  

“Lena!” they shouted, their voice breaking.  

The figure didn’t move, didn’t speak, but Avery could feel her presence—warm, familiar, achingly real.  

The hum of the machine reached a fever pitch, the light blinding, the shadows surging forward in a final wave.  

Avery reached out, their hand trembling.  

“Lena…”  

And then the world shattered.  

---

When Avery opened their eyes, they were back in the lab.  

The device stood before them, silent and cold. The console screen flickered faintly, displaying a single word:  

**REMEMBER.**  

Avery stared at it, their chest tightening. Memories flooded back, sharp and vivid—the device’s activation, the anomaly, the signal. Lena’s laughter, her fear, her final words.  

“I’m sorry,” Avery whispered, their voice breaking.  

The console flickered again, its message changing:  

**WHAT WILL YOU DO?**  

Avery’s hands hovered over the controls, their heart pounding.  

Behind them, Marcus and Elise stood in silence, their faces pale, their eyes locked on Avery.  

The hum of the machine returned, soft but steady, as if waiting.  

Avery closed their eyes, their mind racing. The truth was clear now. The question was whether they could live with it.  

They took a deep breath, their fingers brushing the console.  

And they made their choice.  

---


 


## **Chapter 24: A Fragile Escape (Part 1)**  

The hum of the machine surrounded Avery like a second heartbeat, steady but insistent, vibrating in their bones as they hovered over the console. Their reflection stared back at them from the smooth, polished surface—tired, fractured, but determined.  

Behind them, Marcus and Elise waited, their silence heavy, charged with expectation.  

“You don’t have to do this alone,” Elise said softly, taking a hesitant step forward. Her voice was steady, but her eyes betrayed the flicker of uncertainty beneath. “Whatever you decide, I’ll help you. We can fix this together.”  

Marcus scoffed, his arms crossed tightly over his chest. “Fix what? This isn’t something you can patch up, Elise. It’s already broken beyond repair.” He turned to Avery, his gaze hard. “If you try to take control of the signal, it’ll destroy you. You know that.”  

Avery’s hands trembled as they hovered over the console. The words on the screen burned into their mind:  

**WHAT WILL YOU DO?**  

It wasn’t just a question—it was a command, one they could feel pulsing through every fiber of their being.  

They looked up, their gaze shifting between Marcus and Elise. “If I destroy the device,” Avery said, their voice low and strained, “what happens to me? To all of this?”  

“You’ll stop it,” Marcus replied instantly. “The fractures, the signal—it’ll all end. And yeah, maybe you’ll lose some things, but at least it’ll be over.”  

Avery turned to Elise, searching for something in her expression—hope, clarity, anything. “And if I don’t destroy it?”  

Elise hesitated, her hands clenching at her sides. “If you merge with it,” she said carefully, “you’ll be able to reshape it. To rewrite the loop, break the cycle, and control what the signal becomes.”  

“But it’ll change me,” Avery whispered, the weight of her words pressing down on them.  

Elise’s gaze dropped to the floor. “Yes,” she admitted softly.  

The room trembled, the machine’s hum rising in pitch, as though urging Avery to decide. The cracks along the walls widened, the light bleeding into the dark, their collision sending ripples of energy through the fractured space.  

Avery closed their eyes, taking a deep, shuddering breath. “I don’t know if I can trust either of you,” they said, their voice trembling. “You’ve both been lying to me, hiding things.”  

Elise flinched, her face tightening with guilt. Marcus’s expression darkened, but he didn’t deny it.  

“You don’t have to trust us,” Elise said quietly. “Trust yourself. You’ve made it this far, Avery. You’ve survived everything the signal’s thrown at you. That means something.”  

“It means they’re lucky,” Marcus muttered, his tone sharp. “Don’t romanticize it, Elise. Survival doesn’t mean they’re immune. If they take this on, it’ll kill them—or worse.”  

The ground shook violently, and a deafening crack split the air as a chasm opened in the floor. Avery staggered back, their heart pounding as the void yawned open beneath them, shadows swirling in its depths.  

The machine’s hum rose into a roar, the console screen flickering wildly as new words appeared:  

**CHOOSE NOW.**  

Avery stumbled forward, their hands gripping the edge of the console as the room threatened to collapse around them. The cracks spread faster, the field of light and shadow outside the lab tearing itself apart.  

“I can’t—” Avery choked out, tears streaming down their face. “I don’t know what to do!”  

“Yes, you do,” Elise said firmly, her voice cutting through the chaos. “You’ve known all along, Avery. The answer isn’t in Marcus, or me, or anyone else. It’s in you. Trust that.”  

Marcus stepped forward, his face grim. “If you don’t destroy it now, you won’t get another chance,” he warned. “The longer you wait, the stronger the signal gets. It’ll take everything from you.”  

Avery turned to face them both, their chest heaving as the weight of their choice threatened to crush them. “What if I’m wrong?” they asked, their voice barely audible.  

Marcus and Elise both opened their mouths to speak, but it wasn’t their voices that answered.  

*“You won’t know until you try.”*  

Avery froze.  

The voice was soft, faint, and achingly familiar. Slowly, they turned toward the sound, their breath catching in their throat.  

Lena stood in the doorway, her figure bathed in light, her dark eyes warm and full of quiet strength. She smiled faintly, tilting her head the way she always did when Avery doubted themselves.  

“Lena?” Avery whispered, their voice cracking.  

Marcus and Elise exchanged confused glances, but neither of them spoke. To them, there was no one there.  

Lena stepped forward, her movements slow and deliberate. “You’ve spent so much time running, Avery,” she said gently. “Running from the pain, the guilt, the truth. But you don’t have to run anymore.”  

Avery’s hands clenched at their sides, tears blurring their vision. “I’m so tired,” they whispered. “I don’t know if I can keep fighting.”  

“You don’t have to fight,” Lena replied, her voice steady and calm. “Not anymore. Just let go.”  

The machine roared louder, the light from the cracks spilling into the room, consuming everything in its path. The console screen flickered again, its words flashing in time with the hum:  

**ERASE. CONTROL. CHOOSE.**  

Lena reached out, her hand hovering just in front of Avery’s. “This is your moment,” she said softly. “Whatever you decide, I’ll be with you.”  

Avery stared at her, their heart breaking. “You’re not real,” they whispered, their voice trembling. “You can’t be real.”  

Lena’s smile didn’t falter. “Does that matter?”  

The room shuddered violently, the cracks splitting wider as the light and shadow surged toward each other, colliding in bursts of raw energy. The machine’s hum reached a deafening crescendo, the air vibrating with the force of it.  

Avery turned back to the console, their reflection staring back at them—fractured but whole, terrified but resolute.  

They took a deep breath, their hands trembling as they reached for the controls.  

Behind them, Marcus shouted something, his voice lost in the chaos. Elise’s words echoed faintly in the distance, pleading, urging them forward.  

But Avery didn’t hear them.  

All they could hear was the hum of the machine and Lena’s voice, soft and steady, grounding them.  

“It’s time, Avery,” Lena said. “You know what to do.”  

Avery closed their eyes, tears streaming down their face.  

And they made their choice.  

---

When the light consumed them, Avery felt everything—the pain, the fear, the grief—all of it surging through them like a tidal wave.  

And then it was gone.  

For a moment, there was nothing but silence.  

And then—  

A breath.  

A heartbeat.  

A flicker of light.  

Avery opened their eyes.  

---

## **Chapter 24: A Fragile Escape (Part 2)**  

Avery gasped as their eyes fluttered open, their lungs burning with the sharp intake of air. For a moment, they lay still, disoriented, the sound of their own heartbeat pounding in their ears. The ground beneath them felt solid, but cold, and the air carried an eerie, electric stillness.  

They sat up slowly, their vision swimming before it adjusted. The room was quiet—too quiet. The humming of the machine was gone, leaving behind an emptiness that pressed against Avery’s chest.  

Looking around, they realized they were still in the lab, but it was different now. The cracks that had once splintered across the walls were gone. The light and shadow that had been at war were no longer present. Instead, the space felt hollow, like a replica of what the lab used to be—a faint, ghostly echo.  

The device stood on its platform, silent and dark. Its polished surface no longer gleamed with the pulsing life it had once exuded. The console’s screen was blank, its glow extinguished.  

“It’s done,” Avery whispered, their voice breaking the oppressive silence.  

They reached out, their trembling fingers brushing the edge of the console. It felt solid, real, but lifeless. The device—the signal—was gone.  

At least, that’s what they wanted to believe.  

Footsteps echoed behind them, sharp and deliberate. Avery turned to see Marcus approaching, his face pale and drawn, his eyes wary.  

“You’re still here,” he said, his voice low, as though he were speaking to a ghost.  

Avery frowned, pushing themselves to their feet. Their body felt heavy, sluggish, as though it didn’t fully belong to them. “What do you mean?”  

“You made your choice,” Marcus continued, his tone accusatory. “But nothing’s changed, has it? The machine is off, but… we’re still here. Why are we still here, Avery?”  

Avery opened their mouth to respond, but the words died in their throat. Marcus was right. They had expected… something—a resolution, an end. But instead, everything felt suspended, incomplete.  

“Elise,” Avery said suddenly, turning to look for her. “Where’s Elise?”  

Marcus’s jaw tightened, his expression darkening. “She’s gone.”  

“What?” Avery’s chest tightened, panic surging through them. “What do you mean she’s gone? Where is she?”  

Marcus hesitated, his eyes darting to the darkened machine. “When you activated it, the field… collapsed. She was standing too close to the edge, and…” He trailed off, his voice thick with something that might have been guilt. “She didn’t make it.”  

“No,” Avery whispered, shaking their head. “No, that’s not possible. She can’t be gone.”  

Marcus’s gaze hardened. “This is exactly what I warned you about,” he said, his voice rising. “You thought you could fix this, take control, and now look where we are! The signal isn’t gone—it’s still here. It’s *still in you.*”  

Avery staggered back, their hands trembling. “That’s not true,” they said, their voice shaking. “I stopped it. I… I stopped the loop.”  

Marcus took a step closer, his expression dark and unrelenting. “Did you? Look around you, Avery. Does this feel like freedom? Or does it feel like another version of the trap you’ve been in all along?”  

Avery’s breath quickened, their vision blurring as Marcus’s words sank in. The room felt smaller now, the walls pressing in, the air heavy with the weight of something unseen.  

“No,” Avery whispered, clutching their head. “This is different. It has to be different.”  

Marcus’s voice softened, but it was no less cutting. “The signal isn’t gone, Avery. You merged with it, didn’t you? You became part of it. And now it’s in you—controlling you, warping everything around you. You didn’t break the loop. You *became* it.”  

“No!” Avery screamed, their voice raw. “I didn’t… I didn’t want this!”  

The shadows at the edges of the room began to stir, writhing and twisting like living things. Avery stumbled back, their heart pounding as the darkness crept closer, swallowing the corners of the lab.  

Marcus stepped forward, his expression grim. “You can feel it, can’t you?” he said quietly. “The signal. It’s still alive—because you’re keeping it alive.”  

Avery’s knees buckled, and they sank to the floor, their hands gripping their chest as a cold, invasive presence spread through them. The hum of the machine was gone, but something else had taken its place—a faint, rhythmic pulse, like a second heartbeat, deep within their mind.  

“Stop,” Avery whispered, their voice trembling. “Make it stop.”  

Marcus crouched in front of them, his gaze piercing. “You still have a chance,” he said. “Destroy it. Destroy yourself. It’s the only way to end this.”  

Avery’s head snapped up, their tear-streaked face twisted with anger and fear. “You don’t know that!” they shouted. “You don’t know what this is. What I am now.”  

“I know enough,” Marcus replied, his voice cold. “I know the signal is inside you, and as long as it’s alive, no one is safe. Not you. Not anyone else.”  

The shadows surged closer, their tendrils stretching toward Avery, wrapping around the edges of the room. The air grew colder, heavier, the pulse in Avery’s mind growing louder, more insistent.  

From somewhere deep within the darkness, a voice whispered—soft, familiar, and impossibly distant.  

*“Avery…”*  

Avery froze, their breath catching in their throat. “Lena?” they whispered, their voice barely audible.  

Marcus stiffened, his eyes narrowing. “What is it?”  

Avery didn’t answer. They turned toward the source of the voice, their gaze locking onto the shadows as they shifted and swirled. For a brief moment, they thought they saw her—Lena—standing just beyond the veil of darkness, her face soft and full of quiet sorrow.  

“Lena,” Avery said again, their voice breaking.  

But the image flickered, distorted, and then it was gone.  

The shadows surged forward, engulfing the room, and Avery screamed as the pulse in their mind erupted into a deafening roar.  

And then—  

Silence.  

---

When Avery opened their eyes again, they were standing in the field.  

The golden light was gone, replaced by a gray, lifeless haze. The wildflowers had withered, their petals scattered across the cracked, barren ground. The horizon stretched endlessly, but it was empty, devoid of the warmth it once held.  

Avery turned in a slow circle, their chest tightening. The field wasn’t real—it never had been—but now it felt hollow in a way that made their heart ache.  

“Is this it?” they whispered to the emptiness. “Is this what’s left?”  

There was no answer.  

The pulse in their mind was still there, faint but persistent, a constant reminder of what they had become.  

They took a step forward, the brittle ground crunching beneath their feet.  

And then another.  

And another.  

They didn’t know where they were going, or if there was anywhere left to go. But they kept walking, the silence pressing in around them.  

The horizon loomed ahead, vast and unreachable, as the shadows crept along the edges of the world.  

Avery walked on, alone.  

---



## **Chapter 25: Fractured Reality (Part 1)**  

Avery kept walking.  

The gray haze clung to the horizon, stretching endlessly, the barren ground cracking beneath their feet with every step. The world was silent—oppressive and empty, save for the faint pulse thrumming inside their mind. It was soft but constant, like the whisper of something just out of reach.  

“How is this better?” Avery whispered to themselves, their voice hoarse and trembling. “Wasn’t it supposed to end?”  

The question hung in the air, unanswered. The weight of it pressed against their chest, suffocating and relentless. Every step felt heavier than the last, the cracks in the earth growing deeper, the shadows along the edges of the world creeping closer.  

The field, once golden and vibrant, now seemed like a cruel parody of itself—a hollow shell, lifeless and gray.  

*You didn’t fix it.*  

The thought echoed through Avery’s mind, unbidden and sharp, slicing through the fragile quiet they’d clung to. They stopped, their body trembling, their fists clenching at their sides.  

“No,” they muttered, their voice shaking. “I stopped the machine. I stopped the loop. This is supposed to be *over*.”  

*Is it?*  

The pulse in their mind deepened, louder now, vibrating through their skull. Avery staggered forward, clutching their head as the ground trembled beneath them.  

“Stop it,” they hissed through gritted teeth. “Just… stop.”  

But the pulse only grew stronger, and with it came a voice—a faint whisper, layered and distorted, yet achingly familiar.  

*“You can’t run from me, Avery.”*  

Avery froze, their breath catching in their throat. Slowly, they turned, their eyes scanning the empty field.  

And then they saw it.  

The doppelgänger.  

It stood at the edge of the horizon, its figure flickering like a glitch in a broken system. Its black eyes gleamed in the dim light, and its mouth curled into a faint, knowing smile.  

“You again,” Avery said, their voice low and filled with exhaustion. “What do you want from me?”  

The doppelgänger tilted its head, its movements smooth and inhuman. “I think you already know,” it said, its voice layered with static.  

Avery clenched their fists, anger rising in their chest. “I made my choice,” they snapped. “I stopped the loop. You shouldn’t even exist anymore.”  

The doppelgänger took a slow step forward, its form flickering with each movement. “You stopped the machine,” it said calmly. “But the signal? The loop? That’s not something you can just erase, Avery. It’s not something you can escape.”  

Avery shook their head violently, their hands trembling. “That’s not true. I’m done. I’m *free*.”  

“Free?” The doppelgänger laughed—a hollow, echoing sound that sent shivers down Avery’s spine. “Look around you. Does this look like freedom to you?”  

The field trembled, the shadows creeping closer, their tendrils stretching toward Avery like hungry fingers.  

“This is just another version of the loop,” the doppelgänger continued, its voice soft but cutting. “Another cage. You didn’t break anything, Avery. You just rewrote it.”  

Avery took a step back, their chest tightening. “No,” they whispered. “You’re lying.”  

“Am I?” The doppelgänger’s black eyes bore into Avery’s, unblinking. “You thought you could control it. That you could make it better. But all you did was rebuild the trap—and now you’re stuck in it. Just like before.”  

Avery’s legs gave out, and they sank to the ground, their hands clutching their head. The pulse in their mind was deafening now, pounding like a drum, drowning out their thoughts.  

“This isn’t real,” they muttered, their voice trembling. “None of this is real.”  

The doppelgänger crouched in front of them, its presence overwhelming, suffocating. “Does it matter?” it asked softly. “Whether it’s real or not, you’re still here. You’re still trapped.”  

Avery looked up, tears streaming down their face. “Then what was the point?” they choked out. “Why did I do all of this if it didn’t change anything?”  

The doppelgänger smiled faintly, almost pityingly. “Because you thought you could escape yourself,” it said. “But you can’t. You *are* the loop, Avery. You always have been.”  

The words hit like a physical blow, and Avery’s body trembled, their breath coming in shallow gasps. The shadows surged forward, swirling around them, and the world seemed to tilt, the cracks in the ground widening into chasms.  

The doppelgänger stood, its black eyes glinting as it gazed down at Avery. “There’s only one way out,” it said.  

Avery looked up, their eyes red and filled with despair. “What is it?” they whispered.  

The doppelgänger’s smile widened, cold and sharp. “Let go.”  

The ground beneath Avery gave way, and they plunged into the void, the shadows consuming them as the pulse in their mind reached a deafening crescendo.  

---

When Avery opened their eyes, they were back in the lab.  

The device stood before them, silent and cold. The console screen flickered faintly, its glow weak but persistent.  

A single line of text appeared on the screen:  

**LOOP RESET.**  

Avery staggered back, their body trembling, their mind racing. “No,” they whispered, shaking their head. “This isn’t happening. This can’t be happening.”  

The lab was pristine, untouched, as though nothing had ever happened. The cracks in the walls were gone, the shadows erased, the light from the device steady and unyielding.  

But it was all wrong.  

The console flickered again, and new words appeared:  

**BEGIN AGAIN? Y/N**  

Avery stared at the screen, their chest tightening as the weight of the words sank in.  

“No,” they said, their voice shaking. “I won’t do this again. I can’t.”  

But the device didn’t care. The words on the screen pulsed softly, waiting.  

Avery fell to their knees, their hands clutching their head as the pulse in their mind returned, faint but insistent. The loop wasn’t broken. It had never been broken.  

It had just started over.  

And they were still trapped inside it.  

---




## **Chapter 25: Fractured Reality (Part 2)**  

Avery knelt on the cold floor of the lab, their hands trembling as the words on the console pulsed faintly:  

**BEGIN AGAIN? Y/N**  

The hum of the machine was gone, but its absence was just as loud, a suffocating silence that pressed down on Avery’s chest. The weight of the loop—the inescapable truth of it—felt heavier than ever.  

“I made my choice,” Avery whispered, their voice breaking. “I stopped it. I *stopped* it.”  

But the machine, the loop, didn’t care. It waited, patient and unyielding, for Avery to comply.  

“You can’t win,” came a familiar voice, low and distorted.  

Avery turned sharply, their eyes locking onto the figure standing in the corner of the room. The doppelgänger was back, its black eyes empty, its face calm and emotionless.  

“You’ve never been able to win,” it said softly, stepping forward. “The loop isn’t something you can break. It’s part of you now. It always has been.”  

Avery staggered to their feet, anger flaring in their chest. “No,” they snapped, their voice trembling. “You’re wrong. I did everything I was supposed to. I stopped the signal. I chose to move forward.”  

The doppelgänger tilted its head, a faint, mocking smile playing on its lips. “And yet, here you are. Back where you started.”  

Avery’s fists clenched at their sides, their nails digging into their palms. “I don’t believe you,” they said, their voice rising. “There has to be a way out. There *has* to be.”  

The doppelgänger gestured to the console, its black eyes glinting in the faint glow of the screen. “Go ahead,” it said. “Try again. Press the button. See where it takes you.”  

Avery’s gaze shifted to the console, their heart pounding. The words on the screen pulsed brighter, drawing them in, daring them to make a choice.  

**BEGIN AGAIN? Y/N**  

They took a step back, shaking their head. “No,” they whispered. “I won’t do it. I won’t start the loop again.”  

The doppelgänger’s smile widened, sharp and cold. “Then you’ll stay here forever,” it said. “Trapped in this moment, in this place. A prisoner of your own indecision.”  

Avery’s chest tightened, the pulse in their mind growing louder, more insistent. The walls of the lab seemed to press closer, the air growing heavy with the weight of their despair.  

“There’s another way,” Avery said, their voice trembling. “There has to be.”  

The doppelgänger’s expression darkened, its smile fading. “There is no other way,” it said, its voice harsh and final. “The loop is all there is. You can reset it, or you can rot here. Those are your choices.”  

Avery closed their eyes, tears streaming down their face. “Why?” they whispered. “Why can’t I escape?”  

The doppelgänger stepped closer, its voice softening. “Because you don’t want to,” it said. “You built the device to escape yourself, to erase everything you couldn’t bear to face. But the truth is, Avery, you don’t want to leave. You don’t want to let go. That’s why the loop exists—because you need it.”  

Avery’s knees buckled, and they sank to the floor, their body trembling. The words on the screen pulsed brighter, faster, as if the machine could sense their hesitation.  

“I can’t,” Avery whispered, their voice breaking. “I can’t do this anymore.”  

“You’ve said that before,” the doppelgänger said, its tone cold. “And yet, here you are. Again. And again. And again.”  

The lab began to flicker, the edges of the room glitching and warping as the cracks in Avery’s mind deepened. The pulse in their head became a roar, drowning out everything else.  

Avery clutched their head, screaming, as the world around them began to collapse.  

---

When they opened their eyes, they were back in the field.  

But it wasn’t the same.  

The golden light was gone, replaced by a dull gray haze that stretched across the horizon. The ground was cracked and barren, the wildflowers withered and lifeless. The air was heavy, suffocating, and the shadows at the edges of the field crept closer with every passing moment.  

Avery stood in the center of it all, their heart pounding, their breath ragged. The field wasn’t real—it never had been—but now it felt even more hollow, like an echo of something that had once mattered but no longer did.  

They turned slowly, their eyes scanning the empty horizon. There was no one else here. No Marcus. No Elise. No Lena.  

They were alone.  

And yet, the pulse in their mind remained, steady and insistent, a constant reminder of what they had become.  

“This can’t be it,” Avery whispered, their voice trembling. “This can’t be all that’s left.”  

But the field didn’t answer.  

Avery took a step forward, then another, their legs heavy, their body weighed down by the crushing realization of their failure.  

They had tried to break the loop. They had tried to move forward. But in the end, it had all led them back here—to the same emptiness, the same silence, the same crushing sense of futility.  

The shadows crept closer, their tendrils stretching toward Avery, pulling at the edges of the field. The pulse in their mind grew louder, almost deafening, as the ground beneath their feet began to crack and shift.  

Avery stopped, their shoulders slumping as the weight of it all pressed down on them. “What do you want from me?” they whispered, their voice barely audible.  

The shadows didn’t answer.  

The pulse didn’t stop.  

Avery closed their eyes, tears streaming down their face. “I can’t do this anymore,” they whispered. “I don’t want to do this anymore.”  

But the loop didn’t care.  

When they opened their eyes, the field was gone.  

They were back in the lab.  

And the console screen flickered faintly, displaying the same, unrelenting question:  

**BEGIN AGAIN? Y/N**  

Avery stared at it, their breath trembling, their hands hanging limp at their sides.  

And this time, they didn’t answer.

## **Epilogue: Fractured Reality (Part 1)**  

Avery woke to the sound of birdsong.  

For a moment, they lay still, their body sinking into the warmth of the bed beneath them. Sunlight filtered through the curtains, painting golden streaks across the walls. Everything felt quiet. Still. Normal.  

But it wasn’t.  

Avery sat up slowly, their heart racing as they scanned the room. It was familiar—too familiar. The wooden desk by the window, the stack of books piled neatly in the corner, the faint hum of life outside. This was their apartment. Or at least, it looked like it.  

“Home,” Avery whispered, their voice shaky.  

It didn’t feel real.  

Swinging their legs over the side of the bed, Avery stood and crossed the room, their footsteps hesitant. They reached out and touched the surface of the desk. Solid. Cool. Real.  

But as their fingers brushed the spine of one of the books, a flash of something sharp and fragmented cut through their mind. A memory, or maybe a dream. The lab. The device. The hum.  

Avery pulled their hand back, their chest tightening. “No,” they muttered to themselves. “It’s over. It’s done.”  

They turned toward the window, drawing the curtain aside. Outside, the world stretched out before them—vibrant, alive. The streets below were bustling with people, cars moving lazily through the intersections, the sound of laughter drifting up from somewhere nearby.  

It was perfect. Too perfect.  

Avery’s breath caught as they spotted a woman walking down the street, her back to them. Something about her was achingly familiar—the tilt of her head, the way she moved.  

“Lena?” Avery whispered, their voice trembling.  

Without thinking, they turned and bolted out of the apartment, the door slamming shut behind them. Their feet pounded against the stairs as they descended, each step echoing in their mind. By the time they reached the street, the woman was gone, lost in the crowd.  

Avery spun in place, their chest heaving. “Lena!” they shouted, their voice breaking.  

No one turned. No one reacted. The world carried on as if they didn’t exist.  

Avery staggered to the curb, their hands shaking. “She’s not real,” they whispered to themselves, trying to steady their breathing. “This isn’t real.”  

But the world around them didn’t crack. It didn’t glitch. It remained solid, whole, unyielding.  

They ran a hand through their hair, their mind racing. This was wrong. It all felt wrong. But the more they tried to grasp the edges of what was wrong, the more it slipped through their fingers like sand.  

A soft breeze brushed against their skin, carrying with it a faint, familiar scent—wildflowers. Avery froze, their eyes widening as memories surged forward, unbidden.  

The field. The device. The choice.  

The pulse in their mind returned, faint but insistent, like a second heartbeat. Avery stumbled backward, clutching their head as flashes of the past erupted in their mind. The lab. The shadows. The loop.  

“No,” they whispered, their voice trembling. “Not again. I broke it. I broke the loop.”  

But as they looked up, the world seemed to shift ever so slightly. A crack in the sidewalk shimmered, almost imperceptibly, before sealing itself. A woman walking past paused for a fraction of a second, her face frozen in mid-laugh, before continuing as if nothing had happened.  

Avery’s stomach churned, their breath coming in short, shallow gasps. “This isn’t real,” they muttered, backing away. “This can’t be real.”  

They turned and ran, weaving through the crowd, their mind racing. Every step felt heavier, every sound sharper. The city seemed to blur at the edges, its colors too bright, its movements too smooth.  

And then, they saw it.  

At the end of the street, standing beneath the flickering glow of a streetlamp, was the doppelgänger.  

Avery skidded to a halt, their chest heaving. The figure stood perfectly still, its black eyes locked onto Avery’s, its expression calm and unreadable.  

“You,” Avery hissed, their voice trembling with anger and fear.  

The doppelgänger tilted its head, a faint smile tugging at its lips. “Welcome back,” it said softly, its voice layered with static.  

Avery’s fists clenched, their body trembling. “I broke the loop,” they spat. “I made my choice. You’re not supposed to be here.”  

The doppelgänger stepped forward, its movements slow and deliberate. “You did make your choice,” it said. “But that doesn’t mean you escaped. Did you really think it would be that easy?”  

Avery shook their head, tears streaming down their face. “No,” they whispered. “You’re lying. This is real. This is *real.*”  

The doppelgänger stopped a few feet away, its black eyes unblinking. “Is it?”  

The world around them flickered, just for a moment, but it was enough. Avery staggered, their breath catching as the ground beneath them shimmered like the surface of a broken mirror.  

“No,” they whispered, their voice breaking. “This can’t be happening.”  

The doppelgänger’s smile widened, cold and sharp. “You’re still in the loop, Avery. You always have been.”  

The pulse in Avery’s mind grew louder, the pressure building as the world around them began to crack, fragments of light and shadow bleeding together.  

And for the first time, Avery understood the truth.  

They hadn’t escaped.  

They never would.  

---



## **Epilogue: Fractured Reality (Part 2)**  

The world shattered.  

The cracks spread like spiderwebs across the street, splitting open the sky and buildings until fragments of light and shadow bled into one another. Avery stumbled backward, their breath ragged, as the scene around them flickered like a broken reel of film.  

The bustling city melted away, replaced by a dark, infinite void. The hum returned—not loud, but steady, like a pulse vibrating deep in their chest.  

And then, the doppelgänger stepped forward, its black eyes gleaming.  

“You should have known,” it said, its voice layered and cold. “You thought you could escape, but you’ve only taken a different path through the same maze.”  

“No,” Avery said, their voice shaking as they backed away. “This isn’t real. You’re not real.”  

The doppelgänger tilted its head, a faint, mocking smile tugging at its lips. “Does it matter?” it asked softly. “Real or not, you’re still here. You’re still *trapped.*”  

Avery clutched their head, their mind spinning. The pulse in their mind grew louder, more insistent, as the world around them flickered between the void and fragments of their memories—the field, the lab, Lena’s face.  

“This isn’t how it’s supposed to be,” Avery whispered, their voice breaking. “I broke the loop. I made my choice.”  

The doppelgänger’s smile widened, sharp and cruel. “You made *a* choice,” it said. “But the loop isn’t something you can destroy. It isn’t something you can escape. It’s *you.*”  

The words hit Avery like a physical blow, their knees buckling as they collapsed to the ground. Tears streamed down their face as the truth clawed at the edges of their mind, tearing through every illusion they had clung to.  

“It was supposed to be over,” Avery said, their voice cracking. “I was supposed to be free.”  

The doppelgänger crouched in front of them, its black eyes boring into theirs. “Freedom was never an option,” it said. “You built this. You *are* this. And no matter how many times you try to rewrite it, you’ll always end up here.”  

The void trembled, the pulse in Avery’s mind reaching a deafening crescendo. The fragments of the world around them spun faster, collapsing into a swirling maelstrom of light and shadow.  

“Then what’s the point?” Avery screamed, their voice raw with despair. “Why keep going if it always ends the same way?”  

The doppelgänger leaned closer, its voice a whisper. “Because you can’t stop. You don’t want to. You’ll always come back, Avery. You’ll always start again.”  

Avery shook their head violently, their hands clawing at the ground. “No,” they muttered, their voice trembling. “Not this time. I won’t do it again.”  

The doppelgänger stood, its expression unreadable. “You say that every time.”  

The void rippled, and the ground beneath Avery began to dissolve, pulling them deeper into the darkness. The pulse in their mind grew fainter, softer, as if it were letting go.  

And then—silence.  

---

When Avery opened their eyes, they were standing in the field again.  

The golden light had returned, the wildflowers swaying gently in the breeze. The air was warm, the sky impossibly blue. It was beautiful.  

It was a lie.  

Avery stood still, their body heavy, their heart hollow. They knew this place. They had been here before. Over and over again.  

The wildflowers blurred as tears filled their eyes. “How many times?” they whispered to no one. “How many times have I done this?”  

There was no answer. Only the sound of the wind, soft and indifferent.  

Avery turned, their gaze scanning the endless horizon. In the distance, they saw a figure standing at the edge of the field, its silhouette sharp against the light.  

The doppelgänger.  

It didn’t move. It didn’t speak. It just waited.  

Avery’s chest tightened as they took a step forward, then another, their legs moving as if on their own. They didn’t want to go. They didn’t want to face it. But the pull was too strong, the loop too familiar.  

They stopped a few feet away, their breath trembling.  

The doppelgänger smiled faintly, its black eyes glinting in the sunlight. “Welcome back,” it said softly.  

Avery’s fists clenched at their sides, their tears falling freely now. “Is there no way out?” they asked, their voice breaking.  

The doppelgänger tilted its head, its expression unreadable. “That’s up to you,” it said.  

The field trembled, the golden light flickering as cracks began to spread across the ground. Avery looked down, their chest heaving as the world around them began to fall apart once more.  

They turned back to the doppelgänger, their voice raw with desperation. “How do I end this?”  

The doppelgänger smiled again, cold and knowing. “You already know the answer.”  

The cracks widened, the light bleeding into shadow, and the pulse in Avery’s mind returned, steady and unrelenting.  

As the world collapsed around them, Avery closed their eyes, their body trembling.  

And when they opened them, they were back in the lab.  

The console screen flickered, its message burning into their mind:  

**BEGIN AGAIN? Y/N**  

Avery stared at the screen, their breath shallow, their hands shaking.  

And this time, they reached out.  

---
