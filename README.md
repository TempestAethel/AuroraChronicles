# *AuroraChronicles*

Welcome to the *AuroraChronicles* repository! This is a collection of stories written by me, *AuroraHeart*. Each story is a blend of my original ideas, refined with the help of AI to ensure the narrative is clear, polished, and engaging.

## *How the Stories Were Created*

1. **Initial Draft**: I started by writing the basic outline and the rough draft of each story, including the core plot, characters, and themes.
2. **AI Refinement**: After the initial draft, I used AI to improve sentence structure, correct grammar, and refine the flow of the narrative. The AI helped to enhance readability and engagement while preserving my original vision.
3. **Final Touches**: Once the AI-assisted refinement was complete, I reviewed each story to ensure it reflected my intent and added final touches to make it captivating.

## *Stories Included*

The stories featured in this collection can be found on the [Aurora Chronicles](https://tempestaethel.github.io/AuroraChronicles/). Each story explores unique perspectives and emotional journeys. Check out the full list and dive into the captivating narratives!

## *Types of Stories*

* **Flash Fiction**: Extremely short stories, usually under 1,000 words, focusing on a single moment or idea.
* **Short Stories**: Typically range from 1,000 to 7,500 words, developing plots, characters, and themes more fully than flash fiction.
* **Novelette**: Longer than a short story but shorter than a novella, usually between 7,500 and 20,000 words, often exploring more complex plots and character development.
* **Novella**: Generally between 20,000 and 40,000 words, offering a more in-depth narrative than short stories while being more concise than full-length novels.
* **Novel**: Standard length is typically 40,000 words or more, providing extensive character development and complex plots, often exploring multiple themes and subplots.
* **Epic or Saga**: These can exceed 100,000 words and may span generations or large timelines, involving intricate plots and numerous characters.

## *Why This Project Is on Pause*

I don’t plan to come back to this repo as of now. I started to feel like the more I leaned into AI, the worse it felt creatively.
The *Chronicles* were largely AI-assisted, based on my original concepts. However, *Chronicle 2* has mostly stagnated, as the stories began to lose meaning for me.

In contrast, the *Books* have grown deeper and more meaningful over time — they’re my true passion.
You can explore the full collection on [Runarok/books](https://github.com/Runarok/books).

As time allows me, I will keep making more books that I genuinely enjoy and care about.

As of now:

* *Chronicle 1* is complete.
* *Chronicle 2* includes 4 mostly unfinished stories.
