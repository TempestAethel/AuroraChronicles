# *AuroraChronicles*

Welcome to the *AuroraChronicles* repository! This is a collection of stories written by me, *AuroraHeart*. Each story is a blend of my original ideas, refined with the help of AI to ensure the narrative is clear, polished, and engaging.

## *How the Stories Were Created*

1. **Initial Draft**: I started by writing the basic outline and the rough draft of each story, including the core plot, characters, and themes.

2. **AI Refinement**: After the initial draft, I used AI to improve sentence structure, correct grammar, and refine the flow of the narrative. The AI helped to enhance readability and engagement while preserving my original vision.

3. **Final Touches**: Once the AI-assisted refinement was complete, I reviewed each story to ensure it reflected my intent and added final touches to make it captivating.

## *Stories Included*

The stories featured in this collection can be found on the [Aurora Chronicles](https://tempestaethel.github.io/AuroraChronicles/). Each story explores unique perspectives and emotional journeys. Check out the full list and dive into the captivating narratives!

## *Types of Stories*

- **Flash Fiction**: Extremely short stories, usually under 1,000 words, focusing on a single moment or idea.
- **Short Stories**: Typically range from 1,000 to 7,500 words, developing plots, characters, and themes more fully than flash fiction.
